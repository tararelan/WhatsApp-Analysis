02/04/2023, 16:40 - Tara: Like there are way too many kids studying CS
02/04/2023, 16:40 - Yuen Yin Leung: o
02/04/2023, 16:40 - Tara: There aren't supposed to be
02/04/2023, 16:40 - Jacqueline Chan: wahts abd about that
02/04/2023, 16:40 - Tara: <Media omitted>
02/04/2023, 16:40 - Jacqueline Chan: also about okanagan^
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: Eh not much I guess it's just weird
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: so like waterloo is a good career place for later
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: Idk how it happened
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: Lmao
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: Too low of an offer
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: Ya
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Tara: For sure
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: the us and canadian unis are abit more straightforward than hkust, bc the exams are easier/more straightforward than hk

don't apply to scarborough at uoft or okanagan in UNC, bc it's not in the nicer part of Toronto

waterloo is oversubscribed in terms of CS, there's loads of CS kids there

pro about waterloo - direct pipeline to silicon valley! a lot of people who do their coop go to silicon valley - basically it's a good career place for later
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: ok give me a sec to summarize
02/04/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: n u can read through
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: okanagan is in rural area
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: so it's kinda in the middle of nowhere
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Honestly I don't know why they dislike it but the people ik who got into Okanagan were not happy about it
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Oh I see
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: if u wanna go to vancouver it's a 1 hr plane ride or a 6 hr bus ride
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Even parents were like nah girl don't apply there
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Oh yah that's it
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Middle of nowhere
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Tara: Boo
02/04/2023, 16:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: some ppl like city life some like rural life
02/04/2023, 16:43 - Yuen Yin Leung: perks about okanagan, community is small so it's a vibe
02/04/2023, 16:43 - Tara: For some reason parents hated Toronto (the city)
02/04/2023, 16:43 - Tara: And were quite against me going RIP
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Tara: I get why (?) The winters <<<
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Yuen Yin Leung: also US isn't that bad, Canada isn't much different it's just the news are more centered on the US crimes most of the time
My sister had a nearby shooting near her campus in canada 💀
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Yuen Yin Leung: just use common sense and don't walk through shady neighbourhoods
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Tara: Oof
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Tara: But also
Visa stuff
02/04/2023, 16:44 - Yuen Yin Leung: oh yeah visa pain
02/04/2023, 16:45 - Tara: Isn't it easier to stay in Canada after you graduate
02/04/2023, 16:45 - Yuen Yin Leung: yeh
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Yuen Yin Leung: need to be in canada for like 5/6 years to get a permanent resident card
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Tara: God I feel like my parents
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Yuen Yin Leung: so if they're considering living in canada that might be one option
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Tara: Giving all this Advice
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Tara: Thoughts
02/04/2023, 16:46 - Tara: Thots
02/04/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: background: tara is currently in hkust studying electronics engineering, but she applied to canadian unis in 2019 and also visited a bunch of them when she was there

good things about canada:
- at most schools, if you apply for compsci, you're guaranteed compsci rather than having to apply for it while youre in the uni 
- it's easier to stay in canada after you graduate, compared to the US

bad things about canada:
- getting into canadian unis can be tough, admission rates aren't necessarily directly linked to IB scores, can be really competitive
- visa pain

toronto:
- should apply to st george's campus
- dont apply to scarborough at uoft, it's not in the nicer part of toronto
- ancient buildings, doesn't really give compsci vibes, not high tech vibes

waterloo:
- ugly ass campus 
- can do a co-op here (a 4-year degree becomes a 5-year degree) - expensive though
- loads of people who do their co-ops here go to silicon valley, basically a direct pipeline -- good career place for later
- puny scholarships, but low offers
- loooaaaddsss of CS kids there, kind of oversubscribed (possibly due to low offers?)

ubc:
- you're not guaranteed compsci just because you get in there - you have to apply fo rthe school of science first, then apply for compsci at the end of 1st year
- mixed reviews as to whether to apply to okanagan, because it's in a more rural area in the middle of nowhere, but there are fewer people and you can form more intimate relationships with your profs -- some of her friends who went there aren't super happy about it

other general advice:
- it's less of a pain if you go straight for CS upon entry, rather than a school where you have to select/apply for a major in your second year (e.g waterloo)
- 'you're going to have to work hard everywhere, might as well go somewhere that's worth it.'
02/04/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: how was the cold
02/04/2023, 16:47 - Tara: Wow you got rid of the geese

02/04/2023, 16:50 - Yuen Yin Leung: relatively cheaper compared to US
02/04/2023, 16:50 - Yuen Yin Leung: it's cheaper living in canada than US
02/04/2023, 16:50 - Yuen Yin Leung: but taxes are high compared to the earnings from ur jobs
02/04/2023, 16:51 - Jacqueline Chan: background: tara is currently in hkust studying electronics engineering, but she applied to canadian unis in 2019 and also visited a bunch of them when she was there

- taxes are high compared to salaries

toronto:
- should apply to st george's campus
- dont apply to scarborough at uoft, it's not in the nicer part of toronto

Don't like clinging to people
02/04/2023, 19:55 - Yuen Yin Leung: - the kinda shy/introverted nerdy guys that have rly cute hobbies and are huggable
- huggable is a pretty big factor
- but they needa be healthy to do stuff like bouldering, cycling, hiking with meeee
- also love the ones with rly cute smiles (i love smiley boys)
- gentle, nice and can be up to par with my somewhat cursed humour
- ideally older than me (but idk, might bring this up to therapy about why this is a criteria)
- actually spend time with me and being in the moment (e.g. not constantly on the phone while we're hanging out)

03/04/2023, 00:17 - Tara: program = academic focus (e.g. sociology)
degree = bachelor's designation that you'll earn upon graduation (e.g. bachelor of arts)
when you apply to UBC you apply to the degree rather than the program, but you'll enter those degree choices in the "program selection" tab
03/04/2023, 00:18 - Tara: mhm
03/04/2023, 00:18 - Tara: so there's no program-based admission

03/04/2023, 01:13 - Jacqueline Chan: mood
03/04/2023, 01:13 - Tara: It's good for you
03/04/2023, 01:13 - Jacqueline Chan: it is good
03/04/2023, 01:13 - Tara: Crying = destressing
03/04/2023, 01:13 - Yuen Yin Leung: it is but it could also be avoidable 😭
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: YY why you resist
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: mostly cuz i'm feel rly happy when i don't think about the situation
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Jacqueline Chan: yy no fear
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Jacqueline Chan: confront it
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Jacqueline Chan: we believe in u
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: and going to therapy is forcing myself to open it up and feel like shit
03/04/2023, 01:14 - Jacqueline Chan: we must feel our feelings
03/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: The thing with therapy is that yah you can deal with the overall Issue i.e. what's happening with your parents
But 
Yoy also delve into really deep stuff like you mentioned feeling like the guilty daughter
03/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: Stuff like that
03/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: You can resolve
03/04/2023, 01:15 - Jacqueline Chan: ya
03/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: With therapy
03/04/2023, 01:16 - Tara: Eggjample if ydm
03/04/2023, 01:17 - Tara: When I go to therapy
It's not to talk about the events of the trauma because yah it happened
It's to deal with the trickle down effects
And like
I'm finally done
Have made my peace with it
At first it's depressing and stressful but you genuinely feel better after talking to someone about it especially if you've kept it bottled up
03/04/2023, 01:17 - Tara: Plis friend
03/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: RIP the day after therapy though
03/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: Exhausting
03/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: But that's just a temporary thing! Hopefully
03/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: Also Chloe is good for relationships too

03/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: I like it when Chloe explains stuff logically
I don't really
Delve on Feelings
Like the other day we were talking about triggers and she explained why it happened and I was like aight ok makes sense it hasn't happened since
And then she was like oh do you have any Thoughts or Feelings and I was like nah I'm good moving on
03/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: ✨

03/04/2023, 01:26 - Yuen Yin Leung: i think first session wasn't much advice cuz she was trying to know more about me and my situations first
03/04/2023, 01:27 - Yuen Yin Leung: she did tell me that i'm not responsible for my parents relationship which i already knew so yeet confirmed that how i think is correct and valid
03/04/2023, 01:27 - Tara: The only time I cried was when I was explaining the situation because I was stressed but because I had a good idea of the problems anyway when she explained them I was like aight sounds good
03/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: Ah
03/04/2023, 01:28 - Jacqueline Chan: internalizing it ís hadd

03/04/2023, 17:11 - Tara: BA CS exists
03/04/2023, 17:11 - Tara: But why would he do that
03/04/2023, 17:11 - Tara: Tell him to hold his horses out something I'm going to ask Damien
03/04/2023, 17:12 - Tara: @12369716003 is there BA CS at UBC
03/04/2023, 17:12 - Tara: yeah but it's ultra competitive to get in
03/04/2023, 17:13 - Yuen Yin Leung: y'all rly doing the most for someone who hasn't fully done their research properly 😖
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: you need a first year average of around 90% last i checked
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: What's the difference
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: Why does it exist
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: they barely have seats. maybe like 10 for international students
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: no idea
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: probably even less mathy
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: Tell him not to do that
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: Because if he doesn't get CS
03/04/2023, 17:14 - Tara: He's gonna be stuck
03/04/2023, 17:15 - Tara: We are incredibly helpful people
03/04/2023, 17:15 - Tara: Occasionally a bit too much
03/04/2023, 17:18 - Tara: Damien is offering

03/04/2023, 19:59 - Tara: But later you said there's no forced convection iirc
03/04/2023, 19:59 - Tara: Or was it conduction

04/04/2023, 16:05 - Jacqueline Chan: how can i live a life i know is truthful to me
it is doable and i am capable of loving and being loved 
youve got to learn to take repsonsibilty for your own life and to place boundarie,s becaus eonly when yo place boundaries you can bring all your essence and the goodness you have to offer and recieve back aroun dpeople that are reciprocal with that
dont put your life on hold
YOU CAN BE SELECTIVE, ABSOLUTELY
you know that you have suhc a good soul
you deserve that, that’s not something anybody needs to do the beg for
stay true to yourself to you to your values tow here you wanna go 

‘you are so bubbly and joyful, youre not dramatic’

curious to know about the energy that you hvae somehow laong the ywa learnt to pick from others 
how owuld it belike if you let go of that
04/04/2023, 16:05 - Jacqueline Chan: the quoitation marks were bc i told her that sanny said i was dramatic

04/04/2023, 16:05 - Jacqueline Chan: and she basically was like 'good fucking job'
04/04/2023, 16:05 - Jacqueline Chan: and then we ended with me talking about how like
04/04/2023, 16:06 - Jacqueline Chan: the more i choose my friends, the more i feel like im worth choosing
04/04/2023, 16:06 - Jacqueline Chan: because like, you surrounding yourself with people,and then you become like those people right
04/04/2023, 16:06 - Jacqueline Chan: and like i can CHOOSE
04/04/2023, 16:06 - Jacqueline Chan: like i can choose the people who like me for me, as i like them for them, and that's validating

- has good friends
- not a slob
- independence is important
- has self awareness (as in they're in touch with their feelings and are open to change)
- is reliable
- doesn't make politics their whole schtick
- is open to and willing to discuss my weird rants
- is kindness a given? I guess so lmao who wants a cruel person
- has self respect
- thinks about me and gets me stuff
- has a completely different set of friends from mine
- someone who just idk let's me do my own thing and not Question (like I said independence is important)
- can spend as much if not more than me on whatever
- not a dummy
- curiosity is a must! I love researching random stuff
- mischievous in a fun way

09/04/2023, 23:03 - Tara: I'm telling you one anyway
09/04/2023, 23:03 - Tara: Uhm
09/04/2023, 23:18 - Jacqueline Chan: funny
09/04/2023, 23:24 - Tara: Once upon a time there was a girl named Yuen Yin (YY)
YY was the most loved girl in the village
She was a kind hearted person who enjoyed baking bread in her spare time and loved receiving gifts
One day her best friends Tara and Jacqueline (JQ) went missing (le gasp)
And YY was like omg I have to find them they're my besties
So after meticulous preparation she set off on a journey accompanied by a capybara named Boo
Eventually Boo and YY reached the forest and they got lost because neither of them have a sense of direction
YY went omg naur bestie we're lost and was gonna start crying when suddenly a bunch of wood elves appeared and said hey bro are you lost lemme help you
And so the elves took her to their home in the trees and asked her why her and boo were there
After she explained the situation the elves went omg we saw them! They were accompanied by some dark wizards and they're probably on their way to Fogeidaihok (an evil place filled with nerds)
YY thought naur if they get there they'll be trapped and turn into nerds I have to save them
So she thanked the elves and was going to leave but one of them stopped her and gave her a weapon to defeat the wizards (a computer virus nuclear warhead spear)
And so after a long journey YY and Boo finally reached Fogeidaihok
Fogeidaihok was a strange place filled with weird technology and even weirder people
Like there were ""spreadsheet whores"", ""finance bros"" and ""CS nerds"" amongst other breeds of Wizards
As she was scouting out the place she noticed something weird
If a wizard touched grass they would become an anti nerd and therefore could be convinced to help
So she set a trap and managed to bag an anti nerd for herself to help find JQ and Tara and finally destroy Fogeidaihok
After a few days of laying low and observing the premises she finally saw her friends! They were being led into the Lïbräry for their initiation into the band of wizards
So without wasting time she set after them with Boo and her anti nerd friend
While YY caused a distraction the anti nerd went into the computer room and installed the computer virus nuclear warhead spear
Once the computer virus nuclear warhead spear was in it destroyed all the computers and freed all the wizards
YY could then leave safely with her friends
She saved them from being nerds and they would forever be grateful to her
So they went back to their village and lived happily ever after
The people they freed went on to having happy lives away from Academics and Work

14/04/2023, 23:35 - Tara: Dehydrated, out of my comfort zone, anxious, depressed

14/04/2023, 23:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: Phone about to die
14/04/2023, 23:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: Will text later
15/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: I'm tired
15/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: Are you ready
15/04/2023, 00:05 - Tara: TW I guess
15/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: As you may have guessed I had an unhappy childhood
My family was mostly fine
But from 2005?6?-2020 we had a domestic worker/helper
From when she joined us to like 2011
She was quite cruel
E.g. I wear glasses because in year 3 someone punched me in the eye and scratched my cornea
I told my parents it was an accident perpetrated by a fellow student but it was my helper
So I think you can piece how together how she treated me
None of my family knew or really questioned my Injuries because I lied a lot about it
She told me not to spill so I didn't
Also she didn't hurt my sister
Like 100% didn't
15/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: Backstory
15/04/2023, 00:12 - Tara: Remember how I said my mental health plummeted in 2020
That's because my helper finally left us
And I realised that hey
She didn't treat me right
The most fucked thing is that from 2011 to 2020 we were actually friends
Don't ask
I don't know
15/04/2023, 00:15 - Tara: Thoughts
- I have no feelings towards her
It only stopped in 2011 because her son died that year
- mother would always send her money after she left HK for her family and I'm fine with it
- I don't know why we became friends
At all
My mother thought she cared about me a lot
- new year's Day mother called her up and confronted her in front of me so she could show me that she was on my side and whatever
- I don't 100% blame my parents but it does sting a little that she did all this under their noses
- I no longer feel guilty about not telling them because Ayuko said i was protecting myself
15/04/2023, 00:15 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2023, 00:15 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2023, 00:15 - Tara: Aiyah
15/04/2023, 00:16 - Tara: How this has affected me
- I hate jam
- I don't like sitting with my back to people and I also get anxious when people walk behind me
- trust issues for real
- I never ask people for help until it's too late
Especially the family
15/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: Furthermore I told YY that I don't identify as ace/aro it's just a convenient label
Because parents don't have a good relationship
And because of them and tbh Sandeepti and Efje
Relationships terrify me
Because I'm not open about a lot of things
If I was in a toxic relationship my friends wouldn't know because I'd just never say anything
You know how I was with my helper
We became Friends afterwards
You know how fucked up that is
I know I'm not unlovable for sure
I've had crushes on people I just lie and say I don't
15/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: So here you go
An analysis of myself
15/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: I don't need your support or anything
I'm done with my helper
15/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: I just have to deal with the aftermath and yah it's going
15/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: I am hyper independent
15/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: Bruh Google says it's Stockholm syndrome
15/04/2023, 00:24 - Tara: Ok part 2

15/04/2023, 01:02 - Yuen Yin Leung: Cuz 1) I love that park it’s my comfort place
2) he said one of the small things that gives him joy is a cup of tea by the sea view
15/04/2023, 01:02 - Yuen Yin Leung: So I hope he agrees to come
15/04/2023, 01:02 - Tara: I hope so too!

15/04/2023, 01:02 - Tara: Our baby is all grown up now
15/04/2023, 01:02 - Yuen Yin Leung: I thought about it and initially I was like hmmm it’s not gonna work out, we’re very different ppl

15/04/2023, 10:27 - Tara: Right
I ha e no faith
15/04/2023, 10:29 - Tara: Yah
Once Efje broke up with her because depression and she was really really upset that she did that
She even wrote her a Letter telling Sandeepti to let her go and I basically forced her to mail it
And then
They got back together? Bs
15/04/2023, 10:29 - Tara: Don't think so? Idk

15/04/2023, 10:35 - Jacqueline Chan: and like its hurting your own mental health

15/04/2023, 10:37 - Tara: The reason Efje and I became friends was also because of trauma

17/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: yuck
17/04/2023, 00:04 - Jacqueline Chan: mostly bc the others will be overseas so it makes sense
17/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: ya
17/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: i mean like
17/04/2023, 00:04 - Tara: example
17/04/2023, 00:05 - Tara: i had my friends right
but like for Christmas i planned the party with Sandeepti
when it's someone's bday i plan the gift and stuff
17/04/2023, 00:05 - Tara: so imo you don't have to plan stuff with Everyone
17/04/2023, 00:06 - Tara: ay peak uselessness
17/04/2023, 00:06 - Jacqueline Chan: ya fuck it
17/04/2023, 00:06 - Tara: i planned this year's Christmas party with Sandeepti because the last time we had one I had the others deal with the food
17/04/2023, 00:06 - Jacqueline Chan: mitch just said to me 'idk y ure still disapoppointed, just lower ur expectations and ull never be disappointed, why are u surprised they disappointed u'
17/04/2023, 00:06 - Jacqueline Chan: and i was like 'iWILL NOT lower my expectations'
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Tara: and they didn't buy anything until i was really annoyed at them like an hour before the party
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Tara: because they had No Planning
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Jacqueline Chan: i will just fucking ascend dude
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Tara: i did
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Tara: luckily Sandeepti backed me up because Efje was Not Happy
17/04/2023, 00:07 - Tara: Also YY was fine because she planned the game
17/04/2023, 00:08 - Tara: god bless her she's too nice
17/04/2023, 00:08 - Tara: what lego did you get 👉👈
17/04/2023, 00:08 - Tara: boooooooo
17/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: i think i upset Efje because she felt very bad about the food thing and also the fact that she forgot to bring her secret santa gift
17/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: so afterwards i was like ok
17/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: i know Sandeepti is reliable
cannot say about the others
so i'm just gonna work with her
so i don't get annoyed with everyone
17/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: so to conclude
17/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: find your planning buddy

18/04/2023, 15:53 - Tara: I applied for data engineer at this place
18/04/2023, 15:54 - Tara: ust got back and the role they put down was electronic engineer
18/04/2023, 15:54 - Tara: so how do i like
18/04/2023, 15:54 - Tara: Dear AI Guided,

I just got an email from HKUST confirming the internship. However, I noticed that the internship position was "Electronic Engineer" when I had interviewed for the role of "Data Engineer".

Best regards,
Tara Relan
18/04/2023, 15:54 - Tara: what do i say
18/04/2023, 15:55 - Jacqueline Chan: do u want data engineer
18/04/2023, 15:55 - Tara: ya
18/04/2023, 15:55 - Jacqueline Chan: or r u j asking why u r electronic engineer
18/04/2023, 15:55 - Tara: both
18/04/2023, 15:55 - Tara: if i do electronic engineer then i don't have to do industrial training
18/04/2023, 15:56 - Tara: if my job is*
18/04/2023, 15:56 - Jacqueline Chan: Dear AI Guided,

Thank you for your prompt response - I would like to confirm that I have recieved an email from HKUST confirming the internship. 

However, I noticed that the internship position was "Electronic Engineer" when I had interviewed for the role of "Data Engineer." I would like to request to be a Data Engineer intern instead, as I feel that would best fit my academic requirements and long-term goals. Please let me know if this would be possible. 

Please let me know if there are any supplementary documents needed to help facilitate this. Thank you.

Best regards,
Tara Relan
18/04/2023, 15:56 - Jacqueline Chan: j fluff it

I went to AI guided to talk to them about the email
And when I got there it was Bustling
Like there were so many people working not 10
So I went to find the bosses and I found them with my classmate Yigit
And they were old white men and I was like hmmmm ok
I couldn't find the email so when they were talking to me I was like gimme a second gotta find this thing
And the bosses were creepy I remember biting the hand of one of them because they put it around my mouth
So I was talking to Yigit about the internship and he was like yeah don't work here because the bosses suck
And I was like k
Finally found the email but I was like hmm ok I'm not pursuing this further
So I was gonna leave but some employee proposed to his gf
They were a vampire and werewolf respectively
And I said hey I have [eggs???] In my bag and they all turned to me like w a t
And started chasing me
So I had to shapeshift into multiple animals to escape
But they kept finding me
I was also escaping with someone else it might have been Yigit but idk
Last thing I remember is being disguised as a tadpole in a koi pond but they kept shooting the kois

20/04/2023, 12:05 - Jacqueline Chan: one sec will reply when not walking
20/04/2023, 16:07 - Tara: Today's conversation at lunchtime
1. What we would do during a home invasion during the night
YY and sister: pretend to be asleep
Tara: because helper used to stay in my room I would push her to the burglar to be the first victim then go at him with my knife and hammer

2. What we would do if we were trafficked
First of all it has been established that both of us would be easy to traffick because we don't know Chinese and Hindi respectively
If YY was trafficked it would be because her father disappeared and her brother's wanted her out because the property is expensive
If YY was sent to China she would pretend not to know English and then escape when their guard is down
If I was trafficked to India my response would depend on where
If it's a place where people speak Hindi / English I would escape
If it's not then I would try to escape but it probably wouldn't work out and I would kill myself

3. What we would do in an apocalypse
We would both rob a pharmacy and kill ourselves
20/04/2023, 16:08 - Tara: @6590357204  do you have any thoughts how would you react to these situations
20/04/2023, 16:12 - Yuen Yin Leung: 😂

21/04/2023, 00:14 - Tara: <Media omitted>
21/04/2023, 00:14 - Jacqueline Chan: fucking funny okay let me
21/04/2023, 00:17 - Jacqueline Chan: 1. ok ik logically that burglars dont wna kill u right they j want ur loot, so realistically u shud j pretend to be asleep
but how do you NOT fight the urge to lock ur door put smt against it and hide like bruh
if its alr too late n i hear them and theyre like basically outside my door then id probs start a video recording on my phone n pretend to sleep as well
21/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: Why am I the only one who chose violence
I think it was a revenge fantasy tbh
21/04/2023, 00:19 - Jacqueline Chan: 2. uhh if i were abt to be trafficked n i had even a second of warning then the whole "dont let them take you to the second location" thing would be blasting in my head and id do my best to resist
and uh i dont think my chances of escape are very high, but if i feel like id try to hold out, and then eventually kill myself
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: if it came down to it
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: however im not sure i have the strength of will to do it lol
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: i have never won and thought i could win any kind of physical fight in my life
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Naur revenge against the helper
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: i have no confidence
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: OH
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: The attacking is just
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah do it
21/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Extra
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: if it were a house n its a concenient location theoretically tou could go Don't Breathe on them
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: and turn off the lights, lock the doors, and grab a bat
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: you know your house best after all
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: Ya
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: i havent had the balls to watch dont sleep
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: Except I have no hiding places in my house
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: dont breathe*
21/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: one day
21/04/2023, 00:22 - Tara: Perhaps if I pulled the bed out and hid under the desk
21/04/2023, 00:22 - Jacqueline Chan: 3. i think id do my best to hold out and form or join a society as fast as possible, prove my worth and survive, but kms if it came to it ebfore i turn into a sombie
21/04/2023, 00:22 - Jacqueline Chan: fair enuf
21/04/2023, 00:22 - Tara: YY and I have no will to live huh
21/04/2023, 00:22 - Jacqueline Chan: how the hell did u come up w these hypotheticals
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: Perhaps we should bring this up in therapy
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Jacqueline Chan: funny
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Jacqueline Chan: idt it'll lead to much
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Jacqueline Chan: you both have
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Jacqueline Chan: far bigger problems
21/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
21/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: listening
21/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: her mom is fucking smart
21/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: you know what my dad said
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: "you dont have to be the fastest you just have to be faster than the slowest one"
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: the fuck
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Oh yah and then I was talking about how my sibling would be useless in every seemingly dangerous situation
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Such as a burglary
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: hilariously im the type to freeze in fear
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Omg
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: So true
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: so his msg hit the wrong person
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: i am going to hard pivot
21/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: now
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: j cos i rmbed smt that i was talking to my friends about and realised i haven't shared yet
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: chaching
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: finger guns
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: basically, we were talking about relationships, and i told my friends that i have like, guy best friend trauma in the sense that like
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: his name is daryl, and he was my guy best friend during the whole post-ib period when a lot of shit hit the fan for me and i was
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: probably in the worst part of my life fr
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: so ya he was there for that
21/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: we aren't close anymore but yknow
21/04/2023, 00:27 - Jacqueline Chan: so he's done good things fo rme but he's just like
21/04/2023, 00:27 - Jacqueline Chan: UNDOUBTEDLY problematic
21/04/2023, 00:27 - Jacqueline Chan: in the sense that he's the normal kind of like heartbroken fuckboy type, ykwim
21/04/2023, 00:27 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway one time me n him were talking about standards and he was like so what do you want, and i listed out stuff like oh good grades, he has to be taller than me, he ideally is athletic, blalhabla like i was 16 it was a fairly superficial list but i meant it ykwim
21/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: me at my most insecure wanted the perfect partner whos popular to like, prove to me i was worth loving, WHATEVER
21/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: regardless he said to me smt along the lines of 'bruh do u actually think u can get someone like that ??'
21/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: as in like quesitoning whether or not im worthy of that kind of partner
21/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: and ofc i snapped on him
21/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: but i internalised it to mean that my ideal partner isn't going to want ME
21/04/2023, 00:29 - Jacqueline Chan: so i was talking to my friends about this and about how im scared to tell like, e.g mitch about it cos im worried he'll reinfoce that
21/04/2023, 00:29 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway i told mitch about it
21/04/2023, 00:29 - Jacqueline Chan: and basicall yhte consensus my friends (independent of each other) came to were something like im allowed to want things
21/04/2023, 00:29 - Jacqueline Chan: because i said that , okay, lets say this guy exists that i feel like i want, but he doesn't want me! or i never meet someone i vibe with like that! then i lower my bar, and i date someone, but i KNOW that they are lacking in a way
21/04/2023, 00:30 - Jacqueline Chan: and like, am i supposed to feel like
21/04/2023, 00:30 - Jacqueline Chan: im not worthy of a partner i actually Wanted before i met ? does that make sense
21/04/2023, 00:30 - Jacqueline Chan: like i think everyone deserves love in the sense that you are seeking out this type of person and this person fits you, rather than you ignore some of your needs to fit the person you're with
21/04/2023, 00:30 - Jacqueline Chan: and that led to them asking what iw anted
21/04/2023, 00:31 - Jacqueline Chan: and i was like tbh the fucking checklist aside i just want a decent person, blahlalbal and how it's allr elatively normal things
21/04/2023, 00:31 - Jacqueline Chan: but the thing that i dont think i can have the most, is this idea that i don't want sex before marriage
21/04/2023, 00:31 - Jacqueline Chan: and i've thought about it more since i've had those conversations and i dont think it's necessarily about sex, it's more about like, that whole idea of 'if i said you couldn't touch me, would you still love me?'
21/04/2023, 00:31 - Jacqueline Chan: 'would you still think im a lovely person?'
21/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: like would a person respect my wishes because they love me?
21/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: could someone recognise that it's a very intimate experience and not pressure me into it?
21/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: why is it that i dont feel safe saying 'i dont want sex until im ready', because i feel like the person would nag me until i eventually persuaded myself that it's for the best / to keep the relationship together and give in
21/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: why do i only feel safe saying 'i dont want sex until marriag,e period, so dont expect anything' in order to be listened to
21/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: and basically mitch was like
21/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: people like that exist
21/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: you can want whatever you want
21/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: he might just be q religious
21/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: and my other friend was like yeah i get it i dont understand casual sex or getting into relationships you know you're not going to stay in either
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: i told mitch it was validating to hear that im not insane, that a guy thinks im not asking for too much,
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and he was basically like 'you are allowed to want what you want, and people are allowed to want what they want, and if they want sex within the first month but you don't, then you're not compatible! you'll find someone that IS compatible"
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and a weight was lifted fr
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: not a strong weight
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: i cant even bring it up in therapy cos my last session is at 9am on the day i fly
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and she LEAVES
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: maybe next semester
21/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: but i think
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: this reassurance makes me feel more comfortable to not seek out a relationship for its own sake ? if that makes sense
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: itll find me ?
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: and i should lean into relatinoships that come naturally
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: eg i have befriended one girl recently and it was very natural for me na di was like why am i forcing friendships when other friendships exist
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i am
21/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: trying
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: and i dont want to find out that i betrayed my own interests just because i want someone to stay
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: its not about sex or virginity or whatever, it's about my wishes being respected
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: and about loving my character not what i can give
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: im TRYING im trying
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: self love is an uphill battle for real
21/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway yes that's it i think
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: and then my friend and i spent 45 mins sharing things on the 'checklist' which are kind of just signs of compatibility, decency, and general affection
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: I AM SCRAEMING AT MYSELF THAT WHAT I WANT IS WHAT I DESERVE
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: im gg to write it down n stick it to my wall
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: fuck
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: reminder to yall as well
21/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: ok NOW im done i will let yall read
21/04/2023, 00:38 - Tara: I will give Thoughts brb
21/04/2023, 00:38 - Jacqueline Chan: funny
21/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: At first I thought Darryl meant that there were no guys like that but damn bro he sucks
He's totally 100% wrong
I was also gonna say this but your friend Mitchell is right
There are definitely people out there who will respect your wishes
And you Do Not need to reduce your standards especially if you feel lonely because no you genuinely deserve the best hmph
Also I'm really glad you thought of leaning into relationships naturally because yah man it's really not worth forcing it
If a genuinely decent guy comes along then he comes along
Otherwise I don't think it's not a huge deal but that might just be me
Self fuckin love yeahhh
21/04/2023, 00:45 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah
21/04/2023, 00:46 - Jacqueline Chan: hhfhfggjfjfjdhhdjg

21/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: I love that
21/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: But also that means I have less to say!
21/04/2023, 00:46 - Jacqueline Chan: fucking funny
21/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: Besides yah bro you're 100% right

2. I was walking in sai kung with either my Simran or my family and my dog
I had two iPod shuffles and one iPod nano and I was gonna listen to my music after it loaded everything from the computer
We started quite late
We went into a store for something
Bought rubber bands from these Pakistani ladies
Then when we got outside to my friends I was like hey you're going the wrong way
And then they morphed into my parents and we had to go that way and not to the beach where they were celebrating Qing Ming
I also asked a bunch of people in Chinese where it was and they were like yah you're going the wrong way
Then we reached this tree
Huge tree
Completely white tree
I was trying to take a photo of it but my mom's hand got in the way
And behind the tree was a screen with old videos of my grandparents
21/04/2023, 12:42 - Tara: And then YY frikking called me to wake me up

22/04/2023, 20:34 - Tara: That's my child
22/04/2023, 20:34 - Jacqueline Chan: this reminds me about how my parents refer to the roombas around my house as my brothers
22/04/2023, 20:34 - Tara: That's YY's sister
22/04/2023, 20:34 - Jacqueline Chan: "your brother is too hardworking and never shuts up"
22/04/2023, 20:34 - Tara: The roomba is my child
22/04/2023, 20:34 - Tara: Because I'm the one who uses it
22/04/2023, 20:35 - Tara: Like it's my responsibility

22/04/2023, 20:48 - Jacqueline Chan: so what happened
22/04/2023, 20:48 - Tara: Oh it sent good
22/04/2023, 20:49 - Tara: First of all I don't remember much of it
22/04/2023, 20:49 - Tara: And I'm not going through the messages again
22/04/2023, 20:49 - Tara: But
22/04/2023, 20:49 - Tara: I didn't know how to say this without sounding like a complete bitch
22/04/2023, 20:50 - Tara: But when it comes to group projects idfc who I work with as long as I don't dislike them
22/04/2023, 20:50 - Tara: I don't have to work with my friend
22/04/2023, 20:50 - Tara: Friends
22/04/2023, 20:51 - Tara: And why work with Efje when there are more than 100 other people I could work with
22/04/2023, 20:51 - Tara: But when I was talking to Sandeepti I didn't want to say that because she would think I was heartless and never want to work with me again
22/04/2023, 20:51 - Tara: Actually I think I did say something similar and she called me heartless
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Tara: But LLL I am heartless
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: exactly
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Tara: Sandeepti doesn't really want to work with Youna because when we worked on homework she would do stuff last minute
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: What did u say exactly
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: me lol
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: Efje’s not much different tho
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Tara: And I was like ya when I was in the same class as Efje it wasn't like she did stuff on time either
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: I mean she does her meetings while she commutes
22/04/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: IT GETS DONE by 1159
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: or 1 minute before we meet
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: that is HILARIOUS
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: IM AMAZED
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: IN THE MTR???
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: But then she was like uh but her tardiness doesn't affect you
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: HOW
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: hfhgfhkfhgj ya but love is blind
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: And tbh she's right it doesn't
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Yuen Yin Leung: Bus, MTR, taxi I’ve heard all LOL
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: fucking funny
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: Because I don't like relying on others
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: wah
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: hyperindependence
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: pain
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: Uh what else
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: Shh sorry must think
22/04/2023, 20:53 - Tara: Right
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Jacqueline Chan: but for the fyp itll affect u
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Tara: Sandeepti said Efje is a very good partner in group projects
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Tara: And said I could also ask YY
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Tara: So I did
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Tara: She said she's fine
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Tara: And uh
22/04/2023, 20:54 - Yuen Yin Leung: She does get it done, just prepared to get stressed hours before the deadline
22/04/2023, 20:55 - Tara: Ya Sandeepti said I wasn't helpful during one of our courses (robotics) and ya she was right
But then she said for all the courses after I was a good partner
Basically saying that people can change
22/04/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: funny
22/04/2023, 20:55 - Tara: And Efje has changed
22/04/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: i loled
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Tara: I said like hey I don't want to work with someone who ghosted me for such a long time
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Tara: And she said
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Jacqueline Chan: then sandeepti should just work w efje srsly
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Jacqueline Chan: if she's that adamant that she's a good partner
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Jacqueline Chan: fucking facts
22/04/2023, 20:56 - Jacqueline Chan: personal problems bro
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Tara: I'm being logical about this because she's a good biomedical engineering student and is a good project partner
But if you're mad that she "didn't talk to you / hang out with you then that's fine I guess there's nothing to talk about" which was icky
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Tara: Ya so she also accused me of ditching her
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: abit passive aggressive
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: tara at this point u shuve j taken it at face value n said
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: alright good
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: LHKJAWDJHLADJHKADSLHALSDHJ NO DONT
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: THATS SO BITCHY
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: ANYWAY
22/04/2023, 20:57 - Jacqueline Chan: this could not have been a comfortable conversation at 2 in the morning jesus
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Jacqueline Chan: regardless, i think its hard to work with someone who has proven themselves to be untrustworthy within your own friendship
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Jacqueline Chan: so i think your feelings were perfectly valid
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Tara: And that instead of seeing what we had all chosen I already made the decision to not work with Sandeepti if she wanted to do a project with Efje
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Tara: And I was punishing her
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Jacqueline Chan: tbf tara u ticked all of them
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Jacqueline Chan: bruh thats
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Tara: I did not
22/04/2023, 20:58 - Jacqueline Chan: okay no?
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: What else
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Jacqueline Chan: this is you making a decision that's best for you ? it's your year as well ?? its also your project ?? and your feelings ?????
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: In the end I thought ok
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Jacqueline Chan: thats quite emotionally manipulative
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: If us three work together
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: I'm definitely getting a good grade
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Jacqueline Chan: to say that by not keeping things perfectly fair and the slate perfectly clean that you're punishing your friend
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Jacqueline Chan: but you've said a bunch of times that you dw to see her
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: So if I have to bite my tongue and work with her
22/04/2023, 20:59 - Tara: I will do that
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Tara: It's unpleasant
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Tara: I'm ok working with get
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Tara: I just don't like being manipulated like that
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah dude its
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Jacqueline Chan: damn obvoius as well
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Jacqueline Chan: like yall r friends
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Jacqueline Chan: u shouldnt be treated like that
22/04/2023, 21:00 - Tara: But now the way she's talking about projects
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Tara: She's pretty much set her mind that we'll work as a trio
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: how come shes allowed to take it personal but youre not
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Tara: Which meant she never wanted to work with Youna
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: i am SUCH A BAD PERSON IF YOU WANT PEACE
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: SEE
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: SO ITS STILL NOT FAIR
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Tara: Which is annoying
22/04/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: how come she came into it without thinking that she'd work w youna
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: I don't think she ever wanted to
I was the one who talked to young
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Jacqueline Chan: weakens thev aildity of her argument
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: Youna
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: Not her
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Jacqueline Chan: and you didnt ever want to work w her either
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: I'm just sad
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: It'll be ok
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Tara: I just don't want to talk to her rn
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah it is
22/04/2023, 21:02 - Jacqueline Chan: not

22/04/2023, 21:02 - Jacqueline Chan: to haev your FRIEND
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: Sibling agreed with me after I told her
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: Like if you like the project
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: make it seem like you expressing your opinion or doing something that doesnt align exactly with what sh ewants is punishing her
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: And you'll get a good grade
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: Then fine
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: did she use the word punishment
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: Ya
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: wah
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: thats
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: bruh
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: i have a damn bad impression of sandeepti rn lol
22/04/2023, 21:03 - Tara: Maybe I'm missing stuff
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Tara: I might be the crazy one idk
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Tara: I am Biased
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: then again i look way more at the bad stuff over the good stuff
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Yuen Yin Leung: Tara
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Yuen Yin Leung: This is manipulation
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: bc no matter how good someone treats you the bad stuff is what matters
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: YEAH
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Yuen Yin Leung: And I don’t like the way you’re bei Ng treated
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: YUEN YIN SAID IT CLEARLY NOW I CAN SAY IT
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Tara: Bish ofc you can say it
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Tara: I also think it's manipulation
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: its damn rude
22/04/2023, 21:04 - Yuen Yin Leung: She completely disregarded your feelings
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Yuen Yin Leung: And also victimised herself by saying you’re punishing ber
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Yuen Yin Leung: That’s not right
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Tara: This is overwhelmingly like
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Tara: Not my problem
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Tara: Which is a first
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Tara: Ha
22/04/2023, 21:05 - Tara: I'm just gonna reread
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Tara: I don't wanna
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Yuen Yin Leung: But
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Yuen Yin Leung: It’s your fyp
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Yuen Yin Leung: So it kinda is ur problem
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Tara: And the topics picked are good
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Tara: Like I am Excited
22/04/2023, 21:06 - Yuen Yin Leung: Also youna :/
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: Yah
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: She doesn't know other people
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: I even asked my other friend Betty
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Yuen Yin Leung: If I were u, I’d just go work with youna
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Yuen Yin Leung: I’m not kidding
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: But she has a group already
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: Idfk what Youna wants to do
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Yuen Yin Leung: Msg her and ask
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: I did
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: She had an exam
22/04/2023, 21:07 - Tara: Said she would select topics later
22/04/2023, 21:08 - Tara: Nvm gimme two minutes
22/04/2023, 21:08 - Tara: I don't want to accidentally twist the story
22/04/2023, 21:10 - Tara: Yah that's it
22/04/2023, 21:10 - Tara: Maybe another thing is that she said she'd rather work with me than Efje
But I was ready to ditch her
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: I thought I was being logical
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: If we don't like the other person's Preferred Partner
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: Then split up
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: Who the fuck cares
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: It's a group project
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: It's just a requirement to be fulfilled
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: I don't have to work with a friend
22/04/2023, 21:11 - Tara: If I do great
If I don't then also great
22/04/2023, 21:12 - Tara: But yah whatever I was being childish about not wanting to work with Efje
22/04/2023, 21:12 - Jacqueline Chan: hi sorry i split water
22/04/2023, 21:12 - Tara: Uh oh

22/04/2023, 21:14 - Jacqueline Chan: no???
22/04/2023, 21:14 - Tara: The other day I messaged her and another girl to hang out because I was bored
And I told her that I told her and the other girl
And she was also sad about it
Because she was just another Option
Whereas I was like hey whatever whoever's free idc
I guess that was on me though ha
22/04/2023, 21:14 - Jacqueline Chan: litearlly how ?????????
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: maturity isn't about swallowing your emotions and letting things go, it's about being aware of your needs and acting in the least destructive way IF POSIBLE
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: its about peace
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: and justice
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Tara: Yah definitely on me because I didn't tell her that I told the other girl in the first place
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: and not about tolerating
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: okay sandeepti, you need a new therapist
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: why is it on you
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Tara: But yah two big boy arguments
22/04/2023, 21:15 - Jacqueline Chan: if its clearlyt sandeepti that has issues
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: That was the question I had hehe
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: The other day
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: But I was like nah I got this
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: Yah I'm a bit worried about this friendship now
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: I am too independent
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Tara: And probably aloof
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Jacqueline Chan: tara.
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Jacqueline Chan: you are
22/04/2023, 21:16 - Jacqueline Chan: but

22/04/2023, 21:34 - Tara: I was also thinking of doing a final year thesis
22/04/2023, 21:34 - Jacqueline Chan: i think the expectations differ depending on the number of students
22/04/2023, 21:34 - Tara: But I don't meet the requirements
Because I never did the undergraduate research thing
22/04/2023, 21:34 - Jacqueline Chan: can you sing up for multiple projects

22/04/2023, 21:34 - Tara: True

22/04/2023, 21:35 - Tara: I'm not Useless

22/04/2023, 21:35 - Tara: Different people have different skills
22/04/2023, 21:35 - Tara: And because I fucking hate circuits
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Tara: That already cancels half of them
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Tara: The projects*
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Tara: Like the only reason I passed that course was because I was working with other people on the homework
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Tara: Not Efje because she never showed up to our homework / lab checking sessions ✨
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Jacqueline Chan: i think having a worse case scenario of working with them as a trio
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Jacqueline Chan: is one thing
22/04/2023, 21:36 - Jacqueline Chan: and then
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: meeting profs and asking them how you could realistically
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: work with them solo
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: becuase you want to challenge yourself, despite not being very good at circuits
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: and that you might need some extra help and guidance
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: but you really want to try
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: its not illegal to talk to profs
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Jacqueline Chan: also might be a useful recommendation letter / contact
22/04/2023, 21:37 - Tara: Jacqueline it's ok
Serjously

22/04/2023, 23:44 - Tara: That I am independent
22/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: and how ure being asked/forced to work tgt consistently for a year
22/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: because she cant see you as often, she makes it seem like its all your fault and youre betraying her
22/04/2023, 23:45 - Yuen Yin Leung: yeah i feel like she's too dependent on ppl
22/04/2023, 23:45 - Tara: She doesn't fully understand my personality because I've never indicated anything

22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: how are yall best friends if yall have to spend all ur time tgt
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: doesnt that make yall each other's 'only friend' instead of bes tfriend

22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: not even close enough to be secure about yall meeting other people
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Tara: I definitely had more friends than her
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Tara: This is a her issue
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: i understand sandeepti's been betrayed by efje and i get the trust issues
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: BUT HOW COULD SHE GET BACK TGT W HER
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and i get the vibe this has started since before efje
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: regardless
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Tara: Because she had no other friends
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Tara: Hmm lemme think
22/04/2023, 23:46 - Tara: Thing is
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: maybe she should make more freaking friends instead of accusing all the friends that have other friends that they are betraying her
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: We got really close while they were dating
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: by choosing to prioritise themselves and not do what benefits her most
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: Before that we were just good friends
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: Normal friends
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: because .... she talked about her and you helped?
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: Ye

22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: But stuff changes lah
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: tara you dont have a tendency to talk that much about you
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: for long
22/04/2023, 23:47 - Tara: I don't have much going on my life
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Tara: No I hate it
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Tara: It's only if I'm distressed
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: i love talking about myself it reinforces that i can talk to people that care about me and my wellbeing
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: i think its a good practice
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: rather than seein ghow you can service others
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Yuen Yin Leung: tara when she got mad about using her as an option she said smth like "ik we aren't close or anything cuz of exchange"
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Yuen Yin Leung: ors mth like that?
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: by allowing them to talk about themselves
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Tara: Ya
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Yuen Yin Leung: that's fucked
22/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: IT IS FUCKED

22/04/2023, 23:49 - Jacqueline Chan: wdym
22/04/2023, 23:50 - Tara: You know the trauma
That's the furthest I can go with anyone

22/04/2023, 23:50 - Jacqueline Chan: ah i see
22/04/2023, 23:50 - Tara: I have trouble talking about private stuff
22/04/2023, 23:50 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah people have their own boundaries la

22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: I don't think Chloe understands the problem
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: Because I told her that I don't tell people a lot of things
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: i think you need a new counsellor
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: And she was like is it because you're scared of them telling other people or Another Option
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: that has a different way of approaching trauma
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: And I was like both
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: so you can see another persepctive
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: And she said yah that's normal
22/04/2023, 23:51 - Tara: You're just putting up boundaries
22/04/2023, 23:52 - Jacqueline Chan: ya w regards to trauma sharing j do what u want
22/04/2023, 23:52 - Tara: It's not even trauma sharing
22/04/2023, 23:52 - Tara: There are certain topics that I feel fine talking to some people about but not others
22/04/2023, 23:52 - Tara: Even if we're super close

22/04/2023, 23:55 - Tara: Like that sorta thing
22/04/2023, 23:55 - Jacqueline Chan: my most brutal opinion is that i think she is too used to being able to do what she wants and damnding your attention when she wants that she interprets any deviation from that as betrayal
22/04/2023, 23:55 - Jacqueline Chan: so i think
22/04/2023, 23:55 - Jacqueline Chan: youve spoilt her
22/04/2023, 23:56 - Tara: I have

- 'me being hurt is me manipulating you'
23/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: Sandeepti Singh:

Best regards,
23/04/2023, 01:04 - Tara: I had time to process.
Thank you for taking accountability for the miscommunication.
I think for the sake of our friendship it would be best to not work on the FYP together.
I think what hurt me the most throughout this was that I made it clear multiple times that, although I promised not to treat you differently, I do not want to interact with Efje because I've had my own relationship problems with her.
However I think being asked to work as a trio, even if it were to best align with our academic interests, goes against a boundary I had reiterated several times.
I felt like my words and feelings and discomfort were not being taken seriously and I was being accused of abandoning you even though I was just trying to uphold my boundaries.
And that really hurt me.
Thus I think it's best if we do not work together and remain friends.
I don't want to work in a project with you two and build up resentment over time.
I hope you'll understand where I'm coming from.
I think it's for the best.

23/04/2023, 19:57 - Tara: Broken clay pot in dream is unfortunately a warning alert for fallen hopes, despair, sadness and loss. Your feelings for someone is dead. You need to proceed carefully and weigh all the pros and cons of your decisions. The dream is a premonition for the two choices or directions. You feel your voice does not matter or that your opinion does not count.
23/04/2023, 19:57 - Tara: I called you weirdo
23/04/2023, 19:57 - Tara: And then

23/04/2023, 23:40 - Tara: Is severely depressed
Cuts himself frequency
Has chronic pain so at one point had to use a wheelchair
He dated this dude who hated the wheelchair and who eventually beat and raped him
And let's talk about his childhood
He was raised in a monastery
He was regularly beaten at said monastery
So he runs away with his favourite monk
Who proceeded to pimp him (a child) out to other men
Police comes monk kills himself Jude is taken to an orphanage and is adopted
His adoptive parents were abusive as fuck
So he runs away
While he's out he hitches a ride from this doctor
Who iirc kinda mutilated him and raped him
Then ran Jude over with his car
That's where the chronic pain comes from
Anyway in the end his lover and friends died in a car crash
So he killed himself
23/04/2023, 23:40 - Tara: I understand
Trauma bad

24/04/2023, 23:43 - Tara: mine ended Early lmao
24/04/2023, 23:43 - Jacqueline Chan: talked about how i asked for an extension and prof didnt give it to me and i felt a bit betrayed because like, i felt like i had shown prof enough that i cared about her class and about being a good student overall, and how me asking for an extension even thouhg i wasn't 100% sure about it was a way I showed trust because Im asking for help which i find difficult with people i dont rly know super well
24/04/2023, 23:43 - Jacqueline Chan: and how her not giving back to me made me rly sad bc like
24/04/2023, 23:43 - Jacqueline Chan: oh i misjudged again
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: and i have a thing were i am scared to meet people
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: bc i am scared that like
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: i misjudge how much they like me, i overestimate, and then i end up scaring them away
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: even though psychology says the opposite, people normally like you more than you think
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway trauma
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: and about how i felt like because of this interaction, even if prof was just following protocol, it made me feel like taking revenge
24/04/2023, 23:44 - Jacqueline Chan: even though i wouldn't actually
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: its not a revenge that would affect her its more so just for me like
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: before i was like, counting on my fingers how many profs would be open to writing one of my 5 recommendation letters for med school
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: 3-5 letters
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: and i hoped she would be one
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: but now im like
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: expanding my horizons a bit because like
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: why does it have to be a prof?
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: abundance mindset hello
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: why do i have to be afraid that no other prof or person better than a prof will like me enough to write a rec letter
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: my mini revenge would be
24/04/2023, 23:45 - Jacqueline Chan: working with her for the next year, mentioning my med school, making her think we're close
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and then asking 5 other people to write my letters
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: idk if ill do it la ill probs not care soon but like
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: it reminded me that i have choice
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and in tha tmoment i'd rather find 7 new options for my rec letter than let her write it
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: lol
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: out of spite
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway then we talked about my mom
24/04/2023, 23:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and how she has a big thing about power and control, because when she was younger she had none of it until she was about like, 20
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: and since then she's really needed control in her life, and it shows in all her relationships, to different extents
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: and how thats affected me
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: and then we talked about how i really do idolize my mom because shes a warrior and The Independent Woman and has strength that i aspire to have
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: and how our relatioship has gotten a lot better since she calmed the fuck down and stopped being so depressed
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: covid sucked fr when we were in lockdown
24/04/2023, 23:47 - Jacqueline Chan: she was damn depressed like
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: she said it for  like a couple years before that, but she started saying it a lot more often: "jacqueline, when i die, you make sure youre happy okay"
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: "my only wish is for you to be happy okay"
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: and me and my dad would freak out like wtf why are you talking about death rn
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: and she would joke about her death
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: her jokes are very straightfaced sometimes cos she jokes in hyperbole a lot
24/04/2023, 23:48 - Jacqueline Chan: and yeah my dad and i were very scared bc my grandma passed of depression-induced pancreatic cancer
24/04/2023, 23:49 - Jacqueline Chan: and my mom had been chronically stressed for a very long time, causing me to be extremely hypervigilant around her incase i say the thing i want to say at the wrong time and trigger her,e ven if it isn't my fault
24/04/2023, 23:49 - Jacqueline Chan: anyway, it basically the complicated relationship i have with my mom where i feel like i have to mother her back
24/04/2023, 23:49 - Jacqueline Chan: and how its hard for me to be angry at her because she does her best and i KNOW its the best she can do with the past she's had
24/04/2023, 23:50 - Jacqueline Chan: but at the same time i should be aware of my own life and the impact her own things have had on my own life
24/04/2023, 23:50 - Jacqueline Chan: etc.
24/04/2023, 23:50 - Jacqueline Chan: a surprising amount was covered
24/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: since lockdown was over she's been super like, "self care, con oi!" and taking care of herself a lot more and like
24/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: being persuaded by my dad and i to not deal with soul-sucking people
24/04/2023, 23:51 - Jacqueline Chan: and she's been a lot more chill and better

25/04/2023, 10:35 - Tara: I had a dream
1. Me YY Sandeepti were going to a bday party and we were all in the same FYP group until I remembered YY was mech
YY started acting like an NPC and attacked a potted plant for some reason
2. I was home and there were a bunch of white girls (I think mother's colleagues daughters) and they were talking about books and one of them asked me what I read as a child so I told her and offered to lend some books
3. I stole Barney Stinson's (from how I met your mother) phone and I found Jacqueline's number in it and I was gonna show it to you guys but because the phone was so old I didn't have the charger
25/04/2023, 10:45 - Yuen Yin Leung: > YY was mech
> YY started acting like an NPC and attacked a potted plant
25/04/2023, 10:45 - Yuen Yin Leung: LMAO
25/04/2023, 10:45 - Yuen Yin Leung: Mech students in a nutshell
25/04/2023, 10:54 - Tara: Ma'am 😭
25/04/2023, 10:55 - Tara: How do you
Relieve anxiety
It's been there for days and I feel terrible
25/04/2023, 10:55 - Tara: Annoyance
25/04/2023, 10:57 - Yuen Yin Leung: what's the source of the anxiety
25/04/2023, 10:57 - Yuen Yin Leung: i just lie down and just listen to music
25/04/2023, 11:06 - Tara: I listen to music 24/7 unfortunately
25/04/2023, 11:07 - Tara: Wait I message back bye
25/04/2023, 11:19 - Yuen Yin Leung: baibai
25/04/2023, 11:44 - Tara: Getting a message from her
Seeing her in person and either
Making small talk
Ignoring her
The eventual talk we'll have to smooth everything over (hopefully)
25/04/2023, 13:01 - Tara: I'm sleepy
25/04/2023, 13:01 - Tara: And hungry

25/04/2023, 23:29 - Tara: I don't do stuff because it's convenient
25/04/2023, 23:29 - Tara: Terrible
25/04/2023, 23:44 - Tara: Hmm you know what
I don't think I've been a good friend either
In November there was an incident where I didn't trust her and Efje and took someone elses side
And basically went offline because confrontation bad and I had to go buy a bday gift for YY
When I got back though she explained that it was a misunderstanding and I stressed her out because I didn't respond to anything
Which is fair enough and yah definitely my fault
So I apologised and promised it'd never happen again and that I'd not be biased in these things
Maybe she should've dropped me then too
I'm a dumdum because I take things seriously and have big trust issues
Because of their relationship I lumped them together and because Efje was horrible I subconsciously decided that Sandeepti took on some of her habits
Have I stopped doing that though? Yes
Their issues be separate

27/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Yep
27/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: honestly i was thinking about it right
27/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: about what you should do about them
27/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: I was gonna let it go
27/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: and my opinion is that you should have a think about whether or not you want to continue being friends with them because of who they are, rather than about whether or not you're scared about being a bad friend
27/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: as in like, if the bottom line is that they don't improve
27/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: u gets
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: especially if you think you have done the best you could in the circumstances you were in
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Tara: I thought Sandeepti was a great person
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: i think making a decision would liberate some of the anxiety
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: mhmm?
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Tara: There were no problems until she went on exchange
27/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: mmm
27/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: so 2023
27/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: Ya
27/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: We've been friends since 2021
27/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: Honestly I kinda think that my good friendships fall apart within two years
One exception is the HS group
27/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: But that's really depressing
27/04/2023, 00:36 - Tara: Yah when she went on exchange
27/04/2023, 00:36 - Tara: We didn't talk as much
27/04/2023, 00:36 - Tara: I was focused more on the people in HK
27/04/2023, 00:36 - Tara: And you because of our weekly MC sesh
27/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: We did call like once a week
27/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: Then
I don't know
27/04/2023, 00:38 - Jacqueline Chan: do you still want to be friends and give her a chance
27/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: I dunno
27/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Bottom line is that I want us to be on ok terms
27/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Uhh
27/04/2023, 00:39 - Jacqueline Chan: hi yuen yin
27/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Hiya
27/04/2023, 00:40 - Tara: Last summer I was told to learn how to let go of people
27/04/2023, 00:40 - Tara: And I'm afraid I'm starting to do that easily
27/04/2023, 00:41 - Yuen Yin Leung: Hiua
27/04/2023, 00:41 - Yuen Yin Leung: *hiya
27/04/2023, 00:41 - Yuen Yin Leung: I was gonna pass out

27/04/2023, 00:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: LMFAO
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Tara: Oyo
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Tara: Parents would say to drop her
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Jacqueline Chan: i personally think you should take this as a sign of how bad it can get, and assume that she wont get better unless she actively shows to
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Tara: Uh YY is also leaning towards that
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: Question did she arrange calls or did you
27/04/2023, 00:42 - Jacqueline Chan: bc it hink anger brings out the worst in people
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: Both
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Yuen Yin Leung: And was it a weekly scheduled call
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Jacqueline Chan: but its also important to see you gets
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: Yeah pretty much
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Yuen Yin Leung: Ok valid
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Jacqueline Chan: but if you end up still being friends w her then its ur choice, but if u keep complaining about it after cos theres no change then i definitely think one chance is enough
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Jacqueline Chan: shes at like a 45 degree angle
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Jacqueline Chan: a 60 degree angle
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: That's true
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Jacqueline Chan: thats nice ig
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: I don't wanna stay friends with someone and complain
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: That's just so
27/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: Bitchy

27/04/2023, 00:45 - Jacqueline Chan: they assumed that we were where we were before, instead of at a trust deficit

And then asking me if I could do the wave/whether my left arm was working because when Efje does the wave she looks like an octopus
In the dream I was relieved
I woke up and checked whether she sent anything but nah
So my subconscious wants me to give her another chance

27/04/2023, 16:59 - Tara: The dungeon master (DM) has a storyline
The players all make their characters and backstories and motivations
Then each character can do an Action
And each action is related to a dice roll (and there are different dices for different actions)
If you roll a high number then it's a success otherwise Failure

28/04/2023, 17:54 - Tara: There is no one definitive answer to this question as the APA style guide does not provide specific instructions on how to cite public domain books. However, a general rule of thumb would be to include the author’s name, the title of the book, the date of publication (if available), and the URL of the book’s page on the website where it was accessed.
28/04/2023, 17:54 - Tara: yah i guess this is fine

29/04/2023, 00:09 - Tara: You've read them
29/04/2023, 00:09 - Tara: If I'm not on good terms with someone

29/04/2023, 00:10 - Jacqueline Chan: i feel like
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: I dreamt about Siddarth about seven times
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: Until I talked to him
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Yuen Yin Leung: bruh
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Jacqueline Chan: this is a deeper issue than apologizing to her 😭
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: And we were back on ok terms
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: Actually talking to him rn is very awkward and I delete all our conversations after
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: But
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Tara: There's no lingering emotions
29/04/2023, 00:10 - Jacqueline Chan: but what happens when you eventually are unable to be back on okay terms wtih someone
29/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: Let them go permanently
29/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: Like with Efje
29/04/2023, 00:11 - Tara: Completely ignore them

29/04/2023, 00:18 - Tara: Aw no
29/04/2023, 00:18 - Jacqueline Chan: and slowly learned to not give a flying shit
29/04/2023, 00:18 - Tara: Oh another reason why is that I now hate getting messages on WhatsApp because I'm like oh what if it's from her
29/04/2023, 00:18 - Jacqueline Chan: easy
29/04/2023, 00:18 - Jacqueline Chan: mute her

29/04/2023, 00:19 - Yuen Yin Leung: it's so good
29/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: Seriously
29/04/2023, 00:19 - Yuen Yin Leung: i don't read books so that's saying smth
29/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: In life
29/04/2023, 00:19 - Tara: I'm letting things go easier
29/04/2023, 00:19 - Jacqueline Chan: forigve urself
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: True
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: people can be good to you and you can still leave for how they've wronged you
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: You are Jared
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: it doesn't 'balance out'
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Jacqueline Chan: theres no such thing as the good balancing the bad
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Hmmm
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Ah I also let go of Efje easily because I knew that I did nothing wrong to her
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: It's built bro
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Yuen Yin Leung: if she rly wants the friendship back it should be up to her to initiate that imo
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Guilt*
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Yuen Yin Leung: i mean, she didn't properly apologised did she
29/04/2023, 00:20 - Tara: Idk I don't remember

29/04/2023, 00:21 - Yuen Yin Leung: 🤝
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: Thanks
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: I am a goldfish
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: there will come a time where you do something wrong
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: Shskxjajx idk man
Everyone told me not to talk to Siddarth either
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: AND someone does something wrong to you
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Tara: But I did
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: and instead of it evening out
29/04/2023, 00:21 - Jacqueline Chan: you can nstill leave
29/04/2023, 00:22 - Jacqueline Chan: and improve yourself so you dont do the thing again
29/04/2023, 00:22 - Jacqueline Chan: if we both punch each other in the face it doesnt even out
29/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: I think I go about life in a wrong way
29/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: Everything has to be even
29/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: Pffff
29/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: Well
29/04/2023, 00:23 - Tara: Thank god we don't have many mutual friends
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: so if you punch her in the face once
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: does that mean she can punch you once
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: and youll forgive her
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: or does it mean
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: you try to make it up to her
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Tara: I know it's wrong but yah pretty much
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Tara: Remember why I don't hate my helper
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Tara: Her son died
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Tara: It's even
29/04/2023, 00:24 - Jacqueline Chan: ok what if someone punches you once
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Idc about her anymore
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think that you have a free pass to punch them back
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Hmmmmmmm
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: It's bad
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: I see what you mean
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Tara: Punching is bad don't do it
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: and if you punch someone
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: you should probably go figure out why you punched them
29/04/2023, 00:25 - Jacqueline Chan: and fix your issues
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: and then befriend them again, having changed
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: and knowing you wont punch them again
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: its not a perfect analogy but it works i guess
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: for now
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Tara: Yah it works
29/04/2023, 00:26 - Jacqueline Chan: yy what do u think
29/04/2023, 00:27 - Yuen Yin Leung: hold up my wifi died reading now
29/04/2023, 00:27 - Tara: Welp I apologise for the mess that are all my relationships
It's silly
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Jacqueline Chan: y r u apologizing
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Yuen Yin Leung: funky analogy but yeah I agree
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Yuen Yin Leung: stop apologising
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Yuen Yin Leung: and also do NOT msg sandy tmr
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Tara: I am a perfectionist
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Tara: Seriously
29/04/2023, 00:28 - Tara: I don't like
Messy things
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: I hold myself to high standards
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Yuen Yin Leung: be comfortable being uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Yuen Yin Leung: cuz nothing is gonna be perfect
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: Yah I hate that
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: Fine
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: Chloe is useless
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: So useless
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Yuen Yin Leung: promise?
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Tara: Ok I promise
29/04/2023, 00:29 - Yuen Yin Leung: good good
29/04/2023, 00:30 - Tara: I stg
29/04/2023, 00:30 - Tara: She just said that relationships change over time etc etc
29/04/2023, 00:30 - Tara: And that I overthink
29/04/2023, 00:30 - Tara: This part is true
29/04/2023, 00:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: i mean yeah they do change...
29/04/2023, 00:31 - Tara: It's not helpfulll
29/04/2023, 00:31 - Tara: Ofc they change
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Relationships change but how does one deal with that without being plagued by anxiety
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Useless
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Music does nothing
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Talking also does nothing
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: cut them off :))))
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: jkjk
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: You know what helps
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Closure ✨
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Jacqueline Chan: confront the traumatic roots of what makes you seek good terms with people
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: Helper
29/04/2023, 00:32 - Tara: That's it
29/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: eg maybe you want it to be even because otherwise, you suffered for nothing
29/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: or maybe you need it to be on good terms beacuse that's how you learned to feel safe
29/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: if you both agreed to end on good terms already, then that means they acnt hurt you anymore
29/04/2023, 00:33 - Jacqueline Chan: thats how you learned to achieve safety
29/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: or maybe its about not wanting to believe that the people closest to you hrut you, and that you helped them hurt you in some ways
29/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: or maybe its about not wanting to let go of people , because at the end of the day you still love them and you dont want to be left by them
29/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: or maybe its about wanting them to know that you still care for them, despite waht they did, because that's how you show your highest form of love: acceptance of pain
29/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: or whatever!
29/04/2023, 00:34 - Jacqueline Chan: im just throwing ideas
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: Oof
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: Oh ma.
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: Man*
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i shall give you one example
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i fear upsetting my mom a lot because from when i was young, i felt like i was responsible for my mom's emotions and had to mother her back and take care of her, because she was in no shape to take care of me
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Tara: I wish I could say something about helper but I don't remember anything
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: thus, evne thouhg i deeply fear her and her moodswings and am hypervigilant, making sure she's happy at all costs is waht keeps me safe
29/04/2023, 00:35 - Jacqueline Chan: and minimizing time wiht her is waht keeps me safe
29/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: which is why i do what i do
29/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: its not a fun realisation but it is what it is and it brings me peace bceause it means that what i do makes sense
29/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: or like, it is something i can slowly come to terms wiht and posisbly change
29/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: im rly not surprised u dont rmb anything lol id block it out too bro
29/04/2023, 00:36 - Jacqueline Chan: just go where it feels most uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: Hmmmmmmm
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: I'm gonna really
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: Think
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: About her
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: You wanna hear fragments
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Tara: Without the trauma trauma
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: if it helps u sure
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: im not really affected by other people's trauma tbh
29/04/2023, 00:37 - Jacqueline Chan: idk about @85259629100
29/04/2023, 00:38 - Tara: Same it's just sad to hear
But you also know that they're trying their best to heal
29/04/2023, 00:38 - Tara: That's comforting I suppose
29/04/2023, 00:38 - Jacqueline Chan: i think you have a habit of justifying people's actions
29/04/2023, 00:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: ya go for it
29/04/2023, 00:38 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont have to defend anyone
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Jacqueline Chan: it hurts to know people hurt you intentionally but you can't justify things for them
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: I usually don't
What helper did was inexcusable and I didn't deserve it
What Sandeepti and Efje did was also bad and I didn't deserve it
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Jacqueline Chan: yes
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: That's why I was so confused about them being back together
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Because if I was in her shoes
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Hell no
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Run away
29/04/2023, 00:39 - Tara: Ok here we go
29/04/2023, 00:40 - Tara: Wait what was the prompt
29/04/2023, 00:40 - Tara: This is true
There were many nights where I was basically cussing out God and asking why she wasn't getting her due
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: Uh what else
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Jacqueline Chan: or maybe deep inside you blame yourself for not taking action
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: Not anymore
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Jacqueline Chan: that's good
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: That's one thing ayuko helped.me with
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: I was only a child
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: It's not 100% my job to make sure I'm safe
29/04/2023, 00:41 - Tara: That's why I have parents
29/04/2023, 00:42 - Jacqueline Chan: yes
29/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: Tuesday nights sibling and mother would go out to the riding school because of her lessons
All I remember was that I would make mini rotis for myself / the fam and watch Ninjago on the TV
She also asked me to teach her English
I wasn't allowed to hang out with my sister in her room
We're close now but I still have anxiety whenever she comes into my room
29/04/2023, 00:43 - Tara: Ehm
29/04/2023, 00:44 - Jacqueline Chan: why couldn't u be w ur sis
29/04/2023, 00:44 - Tara: I'm guessing she thought I would spill the beans
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Jacqueline Chan: scum of the earth
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: Oh and one day I did
After it stopped
She was sleeping in my room
I told her
Cried for a bit
Watched YouTube on her phone
Then sister just forgot?
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: Like she never brought it up with anyone
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: If I asked her about it I think she wouldn't have a clue what I was saying
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Jacqueline Chan: how does that make you feel
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Jacqueline Chan: how did that make you feel* when you were younger
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: Idk
Nothing
29/04/2023, 00:45 - Tara: It was over
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: Idk
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: I don't remember
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: You gotta understand I only realised it was wrong in 2020
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Yuen Yin Leung: ????
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Yuen Yin Leung: w o t
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: After she left for India
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: Forever
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Jacqueline Chan: what do you think you expected to happen fi you told your sister
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Jacqueline Chan: have you ever brought it up with her since
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: No
29/04/2023, 00:46 - Tara: Maybe my mom told her about it
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Jacqueline Chan: so you never told her about waht happened
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Tara: I'm not sure
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Tara: She's useless
She's not super in touch with her feelings I think
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Tara: She buries her head into books
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Tara: And just vibes
29/04/2023, 00:47 - Tara: No
29/04/2023, 00:48 - Jacqueline Chan: to what extent do you think you feel like you try to forget about what happened
29/04/2023, 00:48 - Jacqueline Chan: to what extent do you identify with the version of yourself that it happened to
29/04/2023, 00:48 - Tara: Oh 100%
29/04/2023, 00:48 - Tara: Sometimes I can't think of what her face looks like
29/04/2023, 00:48 - Tara: Some days I think hey
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Tara: What if I just forget about all this
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Tara: And just live as an emotionally dead person
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Jacqueline Chan: what do you think you hope to feel
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Jacqueline Chan: by forgetting about it
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Jacqueline Chan: eg relief? peace?
29/04/2023, 00:49 - Jacqueline Chan: the lack of hurt?
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Tara: Completely blank
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Tara: Unbothered by life
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: i think wanting to forget about the things and people that hurt you is
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: really normal and valid
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: and not wanting to feel those feelings is also like
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: it makes sense
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Tara: Yah but it's not healthy
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: but i think that having it
29/04/2023, 00:50 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah it doesn't
29/04/2023, 00:51 - Tara: It's not the point
29/04/2023, 00:51 - Tara: The point o g life is to be happy
29/04/2023, 00:51 - Jacqueline Chan: help resolve the coping strategies you currently have
29/04/2023, 00:51 - Jacqueline Chan: to what extent do you think you apply this philosophy to the rest of your relationships, especially when there's conflict
29/04/2023, 00:51 - Tara: Every time there's a conflict
My mind goes blank after
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Tara: I can only tell you bits and pieces of previous conflicts
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Tara: Because I erase those people from my mind
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Tara: I would also erase Siddarth and Efje if they weren't at USF
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Tara: UST
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Jacqueline Chan: do you try not to think about them as much as possible
29/04/2023, 00:52 - Tara: Yeah
29/04/2023, 00:53 - Jacqueline Chan: to what extent do you feel like help will not come
29/04/2023, 00:53 - Tara: I feel like I'm taking a survey
29/04/2023, 00:53 - Tara: This is funny
29/04/2023, 00:53 - Tara: I took one recently
29/04/2023, 00:53 - Tara: CUHK sent it to me
29/04/2023, 00:54 - Tara: World mental health smth smth
29/04/2023, 00:54 - Jacqueline Chan: im trying to encourage you to fee lsomething willingly
29/04/2023, 00:54 - Jacqueline Chan: voluntarily
29/04/2023, 00:54 - Jacqueline Chan: lol
29/04/2023, 00:54 - Tara: It won't because I don't let people help
It's my problem so I should be fixing it
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: This is a major problem with my parents
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: I don't tell them anything that's wrong
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Jacqueline Chan: i think that changing your habits and encroauging you to remember and allow yourself to feel the pain that comes with conflict, is very difficult, because itll probably involve you changing fundamental coping strategies that you have and in the process of rebuilding those pillars of stability, you'll have a difficult time
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Jacqueline Chan: i feel like the link between this and your helper is quite obvious
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: Yes
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: Even with friends
29/04/2023, 00:55 - Tara: When we started this conversation
29/04/2023, 00:56 - Tara: I was a bit defensive
29/04/2023, 00:56 - Jacqueline Chan: have you ever talked to chloe about how you felt about your parents while all of this was going on
29/04/2023, 00:56 - Tara: I talked to ayuko for sure
29/04/2023, 00:56 - Jacqueline Chan: ya bro who the hell wants to admit that their coping strategies don't work and that telling yourself that you don't feel anything doesn't work ??? why would you want to feel pain , especially when it comes from people you love and can't change ??? ridiculous
29/04/2023, 00:56 - Tara: But I don't remember what we said
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: i walked into my first therapy session and my therapist as like i dont think youre quite okay! and i was like "no it doesn't hurt." with tears streaming down my face
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: who the fuckkkk wants to admit it
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Tara: I'm trying to feel emotions
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Tara: But there's nothing
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: it is a scary experience
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: but being in a contained private space and exploring things at a slow pace
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: i think
29/04/2023, 00:57 - Jacqueline Chan: makes it possible
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Tara: I dunno man
Everything happened when they weren't there
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Jacqueline Chan: who the hell wants to open thta box of worms
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Tara: Or were in their rooms napping or something
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Jacqueline Chan: did you think of them
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Jacqueline Chan: when it was happening
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Tara: Idk
29/04/2023, 00:58 - Tara: Don't think so
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: what do you think little tara would have felt
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: if you were in her shoes
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Tara: Hmm
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: again im going to throw some stuff up in the air and see what sticks
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: embarrassment
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: shame
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: guilt
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: abandonment
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: betrayal
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: fear
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: anger
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Tara: I forgot about fear hahaha
29/04/2023, 00:59 - Jacqueline Chan: helplessness
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Jacqueline Chan: resignation
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Tara: This is a good one
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Jacqueline Chan: acceptance
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Jacqueline Chan: hope
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Tara: I think she was just used to the fact that no one was there
29/04/2023, 01:00 - Jacqueline Chan: what did she feel!
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Tara: Probably
Abandonment
Fear
Acceptance
Shame
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Tara: Sadness
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: okay
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: so how did she feel
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: after it was over
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: and she saw her fmaily again
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: and her family never knew
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: or when she had to explain herself to her family
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Tara: Fear
29/04/2023, 01:01 - Jacqueline Chan: how did she feel
29/04/2023, 01:02 - Jacqueline Chan: mm
29/04/2023, 01:02 - Tara: When I think of my childhood
They weren't There
29/04/2023, 01:02 - Tara: As in
29/04/2023, 01:02 - Tara: If someone tells you to think of your childhood
You'd think of family / friends / school
29/04/2023, 01:03 - Tara: In my mind
Family doesn't even make it to the top five
29/04/2023, 01:03 - Jacqueline Chan: mmm
29/04/2023, 01:03 - Jacqueline Chan: i feel
29/04/2023, 01:03 - Jacqueline Chan: from you
29/04/2023, 01:03 - Jacqueline Chan: and you can like, say im wrong
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Tara: It was
School
Helper
Family friends / south horizons
Music
Playground
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Tara: Yes go
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Jacqueline Chan: i feel a lot of resentment
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Jacqueline Chan: and
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Jacqueline Chan: as much as there is like, resignation
29/04/2023, 01:04 - Jacqueline Chan: theresdisappointment
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Jacqueline Chan: im so sorry you had to feel unsupported by the people who were supposed t olook out for you the most
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Jacqueline Chan: and that they weren't there when you needed them most
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Tara: I think there is
The problem is that I'm quick to justify it
They weren't there
I didn't give them a reason to suspect
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Jacqueline Chan: im so sorry that the person closest to you in your home was someone who hurt you
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Tara: Aw now I'm sad
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Jacqueline Chan: i think you're allowed to be resentful
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Tara: Yes
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Tara: Emotions
29/04/2023, 01:05 - Jacqueline Chan: i would be deeply resentful
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Jacqueline Chan: you were a child
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Jacqueline Chan: you deserve to be protected
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Jacqueline Chan: and noticed
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Jacqueline Chan: and attended to and cared for and looked out for
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Tara: I think my year 4 teacher also noticed something was up because she once asked if I was being bullied or something
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Tara: And iirc I've never been bullied
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Jacqueline Chan: i cant imagine how that must've felt lol
29/04/2023, 01:06 - Tara: By any of my peers
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Jacqueline Chan: like damn, you?
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Jacqueline Chan: of all people?
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Tara: Yah
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Tara: Weird
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Tara: Oh I forgot to finish my story
29/04/2023, 01:07 - Tara: Of the day my mother almost found out
29/04/2023, 01:08 - Tara: So I was getting ready for this party
Before that she punched me around my eye and told me to say I walked into a door
So mother came back with a new toy
And when she saw me ofc she was like wtf happened
And I kept insisting that it was the door
To the extent that she fake dialled the police and said I had to talk to them
But I insisted again and again
And then she let me go get ready and it was never brought up again
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Tara: We took out that toy a couple of years ago
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Jacqueline Chan: tara its not your fault
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Tara: Played with it for an hour then told them to throw it away
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Jacqueline Chan: not saying somethign was not your fault
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Tara: They smelled weird anyway
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Tara: Like of wood varnish
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Tara: Ya
29/04/2023, 01:09 - Jacqueline Chan: dont defend them by saying you insisted
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Tara: I wanna play with my toys
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Tara: Happiness
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Jacqueline Chan: this is an exercise about feeling the negative emotions
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Tara: Sorry oops
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Jacqueline Chan: that last part reeks of resentment lol
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Tara: I was thinking of Lego again
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Jacqueline Chan: what role does your family play in your support network now
29/04/2023, 01:10 - Tara: Well
29/04/2023, 01:11 - Tara: Mother actually asks how I'm feeling now
29/04/2023, 01:11 - Tara: She sits me down and forces me to talk about issues
29/04/2023, 01:11 - Jacqueline Chan: do you feel like you can
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Tara: I talk to her mainly about
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Tara: Life
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Tara: Relationships
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Tara: School
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Jacqueline Chan: how much can you lean on your mom
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Jacqueline Chan: now
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Jacqueline Chan: how does it feel to be able to talk to your mom about these issues
29/04/2023, 01:12 - Tara: What I don't talk about is my helper depression anxiety
29/04/2023, 01:13 - Tara: Because tbh idk how much of the depression is from depression or just anemia
29/04/2023, 01:13 - Tara: Fine 
Relieved
29/04/2023, 01:13 - Jacqueline Chan: does it feel superficial? too late? do you feel like you have to omit details, in order to make her feel better? do you feel judged when you talk to her? do you think you are responsible for her feelings about your state? do you think your mom, as she is now, can help you?
29/04/2023, 01:13 - Jacqueline Chan: ya i can imagine
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: She thinks she knows me better than she actually does because sometimes she'll assume stuff
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: And I'm like
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: Ok
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: Good enough
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: As long as I don't talk to her about the real real stuff
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: Yah I guess
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: I don't lean on her
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Jacqueline Chan: what about your sister
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: Nop
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: Nothing
29/04/2023, 01:14 - Tara: All I do is talk about my friend's
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: I think my mom can help me with a lot of stuff
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Jacqueline Chan: understandable
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: I told you right
She offered to find me a psychiatrist
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: To talk to about helper
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think anything could 'make it even'
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Tara: No
29/04/2023, 01:15 - Jacqueline Chan: for what she didn't help you with when you were younger
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think her son dying really makes it even
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Tara: The closest thing was her confronting helper in January
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Tara: Yes
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: i promise you the death of your own child does not equal out destroying the childhood of another child
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: they are two distinct things
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: that do not even out
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah, karma
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Tara: Aw
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: they do not even out
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: an apology doesnt change things
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Jacqueline Chan: she left you with an irreversible, deep scar that you will have to heal for a long long time
29/04/2023, 01:16 - Tara: Would an apology make anything better
Naw
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Tara: Just thinking
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Jacqueline Chan: and nothing will give you back the security and innoence that you desreved when you were a child
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Jacqueline Chan: nothing
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Tara: You are very passionate about this
Approved
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont have to be okay with it just because she experienced cosmic karma
29/04/2023, 01:17 - Jacqueline Chan: a grown adult dealing with the death of her child, is different to a kid dealing with over a decade of physical and emotional abuse and isolation
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Jacqueline Chan: it does not even out
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Jacqueline Chan: if anything, it just makes you feel guilty enough to think of it as water under the bridge
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Jacqueline Chan: when it 100% isn't
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: I'm trying to push out some emotions but seriously I can't muster any hate towards her
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Tara: Or towards my family
29/04/2023, 01:18 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont need to hate her
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Tara: Resentment
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: its about
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: affirming
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: your feelings
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: when you were younger
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: and reminding yourself that now is a safe time (if you think it is) to feel what you were unable to feel when you were younger
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: and to look back at the things that have hurt you
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: and allow yourself to verbalize that hurt
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: in order to move forward
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Tara: I will do my best to remember
29/04/2023, 01:19 - Jacqueline Chan: rather than asking for justice now
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Tara: Because I'm just thinking logically
How would a child feel if they were in that situation
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: youre allowed to feel it now
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: on behalf of little tara
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: that's still in you
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: you can feel it
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: on her behalf
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: at your own pace
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: talkign about it, facing it again
29/04/2023, 01:20 - Jacqueline Chan: as an adult now!
29/04/2023, 01:21 - Tara: Let's see
29/04/2023, 01:21 - Jacqueline Chan: even if thinking about it makes you regress
29/04/2023, 01:21 - Tara: What memories can I muster
29/04/2023, 01:21 - Tara: There's just terror
29/04/2023, 01:22 - Tara: Lemme type out another story
29/04/2023, 01:22 - Tara: That was the big boy
29/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: Year 3
In the morning she punched my eye for whatever reason
It hurt like hell
She just put some ice on it
Then I went to school
I couldn't open it or close it without being in Pain
In Chinese class my friend Alex asked if I was ok and I excused myself to the bathroom to wash my eye
Then in ICT class I was just spinning around on my chair because I couldn't do any work
So my teacher finally sent me to the nurse
At the nurse she inspected my eye then called my dad
Dad took me home
Mother picked me up and took me to the doctor
She asked what happened
And I said this girl I didn't like, iryl, was doing a summersault in PE and her toe went into my eye
Idk how she didn't realise I didn't have PE that day but whatever
Doctor did the tests etc
Came back and said my cornea was scratched
Sent me home with an eye patch and eye drops I think
That's why the vision in my left eye is worse than my right
29/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: So feelings
29/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: Confusion
29/04/2023, 01:26 - Tara: Because how do you fall for a story like that
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Tara: Mother asked if I was like
Misbehaving or something
And I said no because I was a tidy child with impeccable manners
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Tara: Like when I first told her about helper
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Tara: Yah I think I resent her a bit
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Jacqueline Chan: youre allowed to have mixed feelings towards someone
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Jacqueline Chan: you can love them and resent them at the same time
29/04/2023, 01:27 - Tara: I think if she didn't punch me
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: I wouldn't have had glasses
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: Til maybe year 12
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Jacqueline Chan: how the fuck do you not realise that your daughter is too clumsy to actually be clumsy
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Jacqueline Chan: do you know that children can't hide fear
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: The punch is also why I can't wear contact lenses
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Jacqueline Chan: they're so bad at hiding emotions
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: Oh really
29/04/2023, 01:28 - Tara: I thought I was good at it
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Tara: Or I just hid a lot in my room
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: you were a child
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: it is the responsiblity of a parent to take care of their child
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: POST birth
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: fuck
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: you were like, what, 8 years old
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: 7 years old
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Tara: Tbh I broke my arm twice by falling
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Tara: I am quite clumsy
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Jacqueline Chan: do you really think a 7 year old can really hide their emotions
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Tara: But yes
29/04/2023, 01:29 - Tara: Idk how that excuse came to me
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Jacqueline Chan: you were seven
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Jacqueline Chan: you were doing your best to survive
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Tara: Yah that's what ayuko said
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Tara: No guilt from me
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Jacqueline Chan: how are you supposed to trust that the adults in your life will get rid of your helper, if they have never noticed your pain in the first place
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Tara: That's what clicked
29/04/2023, 01:30 - Jacqueline Chan: even if you brought something up, how much would you actually turst that they would do something ??
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Tara: Oh I also didn't tell them for fear of the repercussions
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Tara: I thought there would be like a one day buffer period
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Jacqueline Chan: even if your parents aren't 'to blame' per se, you are still allowed to resent them for not coming to you in a time of need
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Tara: Between telling them and her finally leaving HK
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah ofc youd be  scared
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Jacqueline Chan: what if something happened to you and you were hurt again
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Jacqueline Chan: or waht if they didnt believe you and she stayed
29/04/2023, 01:31 - Tara: But she left for India the same day her son died
But I didn't know it would be that quick
29/04/2023, 01:32 - Jacqueline Chan: how the fuck do you have a child, and hit a child
29/04/2023, 01:32 - Tara: I'm fairly sure
29/04/2023, 01:32 - Tara: Wait how do I say this
29/04/2023, 01:33 - Tara: I'm guessing one of the reasons it all happened was because she was frustrated
Why was she frustrated? Because my mother has high standards and has a tendency for driving people up the wall if their work isn't good enough
There's little room for error
It would be easy to blame my mother in the end
But we don't know what would have happened if she didn't have those standards
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: stop
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: justifying
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: her
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: actions
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: anyone who resorts to hurting a child to release their frustrations against the child's mother
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: is still a child abuser
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Tara: Yee
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont need to justfiy their actions
29/04/2023, 01:34 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont need to consider an alternative
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: what has happened to you happened to you
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: im afraid to hold children incase i hurt them
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: how do people punch kids
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: what the actual shit
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Tara: Yah that's also why I don't hate her
Parents are always saying like
Whatever happens happens
Forgive and forget
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: for YEARS
29/04/2023, 01:35 - Jacqueline Chan: no.
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: do not forget
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: those sayings work for the passing trials of life
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: this is not a passing trial
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: this is not about the little things people do that are annoying
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: this is about your childhood being taken from you
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: you dont have to hate her
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: but youre allowed to do so if it is what it takes to heal
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: yourself
29/04/2023, 01:36 - Jacqueline Chan: you can hate whoever you want, in the space of this chat at least
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Tara: Yah I don't hate her
I kinda hate my parents
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Tara: It's a them issue
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Tara: And ofc the helper
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Tara: But
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Jacqueline Chan: its a them issue, but youre suffering from the reprecussions of that
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Tara: I'm their kiddo
29/04/2023, 01:37 - Jacqueline Chan: as much as your helper made you terrified of a lot of things, your parents made you not be able to get away from the source of terror
29/04/2023, 01:38 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah you're their child
29/04/2023, 01:38 - Jacqueline Chan: im surprised yo uhaven't brought up your sister
29/04/2023, 01:38 - Tara: She was also a kid then
I didn't expect her to have the emotional maturity to deal with it
29/04/2023, 01:38 - Tara: She still doesn't
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: im sorry you had to be emotionally mature enough to withstand the pain that even adults shouldn't feel
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: im sorry you had no idea how to deal with your feelings
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: and just shut them down
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Tara: I'm an old soul 😎
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: tara ure doing it again
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Tara: Oops sorry
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: dont apologize
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Tara: No jokes
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Jacqueline Chan: i saw that coming
29/04/2023, 01:39 - Tara: Fjakcjaj
29/04/2023, 01:40 - Tara: I can't deal with my feelings it's quite frustrating
29/04/2023, 01:40 - Tara: It's difficult for me to show affection
It's difficult for me to reach out to others
I've shoved all my feelings deep down so I can be there for my friends
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Jacqueline Chan: im getting the vibe that 'lets pretend this never happened to me and that i never met this person, because if i did, then i'll remember that people never helped me and paid attention to me and noticed me'
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and being there for your friends is one of the ways to cope with your own feelings of never having someone there for you
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Jacqueline Chan: when you needed it most
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Tara: Yes exactly
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Jacqueline Chan: is the vibe
29/04/2023, 01:41 - Jacqueline Chan: im getting
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Tara: Be there for others because no one's there for you
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: you know there was this post i saw about types of suffering
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: there's the people that are like
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: 'why should others suffer like i did?"
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: and the
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: 'why shouldn't others suffer like i did'
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: and yeah the pain of being the former
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: no wonder youre afraid of being in very close relationships, especially romantic ones
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: what happens when nobody notices if something goes wrong
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Tara: Yahhh that's what I said
29/04/2023, 01:42 - Jacqueline Chan: or, what happens if teh person that's supposed to love you most doesn't notice somethings wrong
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Tara: What if I don't know I'm being hurt
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Tara: And then have a terrible time
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Jacqueline Chan: and nobodys there to point it out
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Tara: Yee
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Tara: Disorganised attachment forreal
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Jacqueline Chan: what do you think you'd need to hear from another persont o believe that they wouldn't hurt you
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Jacqueline Chan: or what would you need to hear, and from whom, to feel more secure
29/04/2023, 01:43 - Jacqueline Chan: or to alleviate your worries about it
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Jacqueline Chan: and, another question
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think you deserve help
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think that you would accept help
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Tara: I'm not sure
People have let me down in the past so I'm wary of Words
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Jacqueline Chan: mood
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Jacqueline Chan: okay then what would someone have to do
29/04/2023, 01:44 - Tara: Yah that's why I decided to go to counselling
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Jacqueline Chan: do you think you deserve help that you didnt ask for
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Tara: From a professional yes
I'm wary of friends because they have their own stuff to deal with and what if this is all trauma dumping
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Jacqueline Chan: youre allowed to reach out for help
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Jacqueline Chan: if you ask them 'hey are you in a space where you can help me out right now im dealing with a lot and i need someone to listen'
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Jacqueline Chan: and they say yes
29/04/2023, 01:45 - Jacqueline Chan: then you hvae permission
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Jacqueline Chan: take things at face value
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Jacqueline Chan: if they say no, then you know that youre resepcting them
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Jacqueline Chan: right?
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Tara: Yep
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Jacqueline Chan: similarly, you're also allowed to say no
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Tara: I didn't expect this conversation to turn out this way
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Tara: Otherwise I would have asked
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Tara: Maybe I did before sending a Story
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and you dont always have to help out friends in a bad spot, even if you feel an insane itch in your soul to help because you know how it feels to be in a deep dark hole
29/04/2023, 01:46 - Tara: I think I did
29/04/2023, 01:47 - Jacqueline Chan: i think kyuen yin is unconscious
29/04/2023, 01:47 - Tara: Hmmmm

29/04/2023, 01:49 - Tara: Aw I'm sorry to hear that
29/04/2023, 01:49 - Tara: We will help each other
29/04/2023, 01:49 - Jacqueline Chan: no im better now after i met friends that go like 'i think something is wrong'
29/04/2023, 01:49 - Jacqueline Chan: 'and i think youre allowed to do something about it and leave'
29/04/2023, 01:49 - Jacqueline Chan: 'and i will do my best to make the process easier for you how i can'
29/04/2023, 01:49 - Jacqueline Chan: im not FINE but i have the support to try
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Tara: I don't give people a chance to notice
If there's something on my mind I'm telling them
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Jacqueline Chan: thats good!
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Jacqueline Chan: thats a good way
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Tara: I told you guys I was depressed last week that's why I didn't go out
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Jacqueline Chan: to deal with the fear of not getting help
29/04/2023, 01:50 - Tara: My friends know that if I go offline for a day it means I'm taking time to recharge

29/04/2023, 01:51 - Jacqueline Chan: but thinking a bit about it and like
29/04/2023, 01:51 - Tara: It'll take such a long time to pull out an emotion
29/04/2023, 01:51 - Jacqueline Chan: considering ways that it has affected you and how you respond to conflict and pain
29/04/2023, 01:51 - Tara: It took like two hours today
29/04/2023, 01:51 - Jacqueline Chan: may help you understand better why you're feeling anxious
29/04/2023, 01:52 - Tara: Shall work on it
29/04/2023, 01:52 - Jacqueline Chan: for example, maybe you feel like you've got to deal with sandeepti and efje because you dont want to leave her in the dark w some shit person
29/04/2023, 01:52 - Jacqueline Chan: but then she turned that against you

29/04/2023, 01:53 - Jacqueline Chan: uhhuh
29/04/2023, 01:53 - Tara: If they don't date

29/04/2023, 01:54 - Jacqueline Chan: seems like she can't be single for a long period of time
29/04/2023, 01:54 - Jacqueline Chan: thinks the world revolves around her
29/04/2023, 01:54 - Jacqueline Chan: victim complex

29/04/2023, 01:55 - Jacqueline Chan: i dont know her story but i'll judge based on the impression i already have
29/04/2023, 01:55 - Tara: And not having people on her side
29/04/2023, 01:55 - Tara: So she latches onto people
29/04/2023, 01:55 - Tara: And if they give any indication of not being there for her
29/04/2023, 01:55 - Tara: She gets very upset

29/04/2023, 02:02 - Jacqueline Chan: i think the furthest ill realistically go is if i meet them and they say something weird and im like 'i dont think that's very nice'
29/04/2023, 02:03 - Jacqueline Chan: or 'what an odd thing to say out loud'
29/04/2023, 02:03 - Tara: That's a lie the prettiest thing I've done is delete the FYP title sheet I had with Sandeepti Efje and Youna

29/04/2023, 02:04 - Tara: Maybe comment on it later
29/04/2023, 02:04 - Tara: Maybe ask why in the moment
29/04/2023, 02:04 - Jacqueline Chan: 'because there are four peopl ein this group, and you didn't ask about what everyone else thought'
29/04/2023, 02:04 - Jacqueline Chan: 'if yall want to go do that, then we can split up'
29/04/2023, 02:04 - Jacqueline Chan: 'but i think making a decision for the entire group without considering everyone is quite rude'
29/04/2023, 02:04 - Jacqueline Chan: 'especially since im new to hk and might not be comfortable'
29/04/2023, 02:05 - Jacqueline Chan: thats a bit too forward but it depends

29/04/2023, 02:05 - Tara: If anything I'd plan and not let people change it afterwards
29/04/2023, 02:05 - Jacqueline Chan: i dont think they'd be bitchy la i just think i would make them uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 02:05 - Jacqueline Chan: i also dont think ill meet them

29/04/2023, 02:14 - Jacqueline Chan: funny
29/04/2023, 02:14 - Jacqueline Chan: i think i have a talent at making people uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 02:14 - Jacqueline Chan: as much as

29/04/2023, 02:15 - Tara: Mhm
29/04/2023, 02:15 - Jacqueline Chan: but when i dont want to do that
29/04/2023, 02:15 - Jacqueline Chan: then they can be quite uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 02:15 - Jacqueline Chan: i think its because they think im actually paying attention to what they say and that they're being evaluated
29/04/2023, 02:15 - Jacqueline Chan: for example i think that if we weren't playing an activity during the call, i think i would hav emade sandeepti uncomfortable
29/04/2023, 02:16 - Tara: If I like someone I actually make an effort
Otherwise I'm Cold
That's why mother thinks I'm aloof
I keep seeing people I don't care for so I don't interact with them at all
29/04/2023, 02:16 - Jacqueline Chan: ya vibes
29/04/2023, 02:16 - Tara: Ahh

29/04/2023, 02:16 - Jacqueline Chan: it saddens me that i can do this, but it is also useful
29/04/2023, 02:16 - Jacqueline Chan: but its sad
29/04/2023, 02:16 - Jacqueline Chan: that my initial discomfort drives away people who need approval first before appraoching
29/04/2023, 02:17 - Jacqueline Chan: aka people like me
29/04/2023, 02:17 - Jacqueline Chan: it do be like thattttt

29/04/2023, 02:18 - Jacqueline Chan: like its okay to want to be liked to not fee lalone

29/04/2023, 02:24 - Jacqueline Chan: *without me asking*
29/04/2023, 02:24 - Jacqueline Chan: or the way nobody has doubted my mcat prep even when i complain about it
29/04/2023, 02:25 - Jacqueline Chan: or the way one of my friends naturally addresses me as "doc", as if believing in my endless potential
29/04/2023, 02:25 - Jacqueline Chan: or when i accidentally see someone messaging someone else in class about a point i made that they thought was really good
29/04/2023, 02:25 - Jacqueline Chan: out of their way, without me asking, without me knowing, without purpose, without obligation

29/04/2023, 02:29 - Tara: Goldfish for real
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: and im not asking for compliments bc i wouldn't believe them anyway we been knew
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Tara: I'm going to have to reread everything
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: i was complaining to my friend recently that everytime someone compliments my appearance its that im 'quite pretty'
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Tara: In the morning
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: and it drives me insane
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: because waht the fuck does 'quite' mean
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Tara: I might reply to more stuff then too

29/04/2023, 02:30 - Tara: Jesus
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: why do you have to say 'quite,' like whats so wrong with just saying pretty
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: is that like a notch under pretty
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: is that a notch above pretty
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: when things are quite funny, they're moderately funny
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: when things go 'quite well' that means they went better than expected
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: so what does it mean
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: HUH
29/04/2023, 02:30 - Jacqueline Chan: WHAT DOES IT MEAN
29/04/2023, 02:31 - Jacqueline Chan: it just drives me insane bc i interpret it as 'you're almost there, but ont quite'
29/04/2023, 02:31 - Jacqueline Chan: 'but good job i guess'
29/04/2023, 02:31 - Tara: Big confusion and screw that person

Get a proper apology without another argument
Snip snip our friendship for now

I don't need you anymore I'm doing fine
30/04/2023, 12:22 - Tara: Even though part of my point was that she'd do fine without me

30/04/2023, 12:23 - Tara: This is frustrating as hell
30/04/2023, 12:24 - Tara: Befriending Efje was such a bad idea
30/04/2023, 12:24 - Tara: Honestly
30/04/2023, 12:24 - Tara: Those two dating was also a terrible idea
30/04/2023, 12:29 - Tara: I was fine working with her before that

04/05/2023, 13:18 - Tara: Bruh
Fair enough though
04/05/2023, 13:19 - Tara: Good luck!
04/05/2023, 13:27 - Tara: I had a dream I had a parent teacher conference with my uni professors and I was quite nervous because I never went to class
04/05/2023, 13:28 - Tara: Then I had a dream I was back in year 6 and I was in 6M not 6A which was sad because irl I was in 6A
For some reason we were all waiting on the playground in a line while it was raining
And I had a revelation that something I built was modelled off my primary school
04/05/2023, 13:29 - Tara: And finally I had a dream I was on the bus with YY and we were talking about medicine and I was like hey send that to me I'm gonna buy it
It was the bus going down to the primary school so I guess it came before this dream
04/05/2023, 13:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: LMFAO
04/05/2023, 13:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: imagine if we did have parents teacher conference in uni
04/05/2023, 13:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: would be disastrous
04/05/2023, 13:53 - Tara: "ma'am I have never seen this person in my entire life"
04/05/2023, 13:53 - Tara: I was thinking like
04/05/2023, 13:53 - Tara: The teacher would say
Yah she's good look at her test scores
04/05/2023, 13:53 - Tara: And leave it at that
04/05/2023, 13:54 - Tara: I want sushi
04/05/2023, 14:08 - Yuen Yin Leung: Probably yeh
04/05/2023, 14:09 - Yuen Yin Leung: “Idk this person but she did well, u guys didn’t have to come”
04/05/2023, 14:12 - Tara: Slay
04/05/2023, 14:12 - Tara: Now that I'm thinking about it the medicine was either cough syrup or anxiety medication
04/05/2023, 14:22 - Yuen Yin Leung: maybe u thought of my cough syrup
04/05/2023, 14:22 - Yuen Yin Leung: from last night's convo
04/05/2023, 14:24 - Tara: Could be both
04/05/2023, 14:24 - Tara: Because it came with a test
04/05/2023, 14:28 - Yuen Yin Leung: oh perhaps
04/05/2023, 14:28 - Tara: Nah the test refers to iq tests
04/05/2023, 14:28 - Tara: I was reading something about IQs the other day
04/05/2023, 14:32 - Tara: Yuen Yin
04/05/2023, 14:32 - Tara: Study with me?
04/05/2023, 14:32 - Tara: Discord

04/05/2023, 14:36 - Tara: nah kidding enjoy
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: wasn't the test designed to be racist
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: like
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Tara: yes
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: it's to show that white ppl smarter than black ppl
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: yikers
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: same with SAT i think?
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Tara: probably(?)
04/05/2023, 14:36 - Tara: idk
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: but SAT is more to do with how privilege a person is
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: rather than smartness
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: the ones who perform well are obvs the one who gets more training/resources/opportunities
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Tara: ya fair enough
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Tara: i was thinking of my Folder
04/05/2023, 14:37 - Tara: every few years they made us take a baseline test
04/05/2023, 14:38 - Tara: basically like an IQ test
04/05/2023, 14:38 - Tara: oh i wanted to show Jacqueline
04/05/2023, 14:38 - Tara: my mom asked me if i could write a script on R to see if there was any relationship between the baseline test and their IGCSE/IB grades
04/05/2023, 14:38 - Tara: that didn't work out
04/05/2023, 14:39 - Tara: so the next step was to see if IGCSE scores could predict IB scores
04/05/2023, 14:39 - Tara: that worked slightly better
04/05/2023, 14:39 - Tara: but still not enough
04/05/2023, 14:39 - Yuen Yin Leung: oooo
04/05/2023, 14:39 - Yuen Yin Leung: that sounds like a cool project
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Yuen Yin Leung: would write an EE on that
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Yuen Yin Leung: jk fuck the EE
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Tara: meiyou relationship
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Tara: the baseline tests were stupid
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Tara: they gave us a predicted grade for languages too
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Tara: did the ytest any of those languages
04/05/2023, 14:40 - Tara: no
04/05/2023, 14:41 - Tara: and the school calculated the teacher's value added
04/05/2023, 14:41 - Tara: so if you were predicted a  7 according to the baseline and you get a 6
04/05/2023, 14:41 - Tara: the teacher's value added is -1
04/05/2023, 14:42 - Tara: it's not sending
04/05/2023, 14:42 - Tara: jesus
04/05/2023, 14:43 - Tara: ok anyway the R^2 value as 0.6
04/05/2023, 14:43 - Tara: which doesn't prove muc
04/05/2023, 14:43 - Tara: h
04/05/2023, 14:44 - Tara: on another note i feel like i shouldn't have been able to access other kid's baseline scores
04/05/2023, 14:44 - Tara: but LLL

04/05/2023, 15:47 - Yuen Yin Leung: 10 days doesn't seem worth it
04/05/2023, 15:47 - Tara: Wah no
04/05/2023, 15:47 - Tara: 10 days is a good holiday
04/05/2023, 15:50 - Tara: What's the ideal length of a holiday for you
04/05/2023, 15:50 - Tara: Just wondering
04/05/2023, 15:50 - Yuen Yin Leung: it depends where i'm going
04/05/2023, 15:50 - Tara: Elaborate?
04/05/2023, 15:50 - Yuen Yin Leung: if it's a couple hours flight from where i am then 3-7 days is more than enough
04/05/2023, 15:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: if it's all the way across the country
04/05/2023, 15:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: i'll rarely go there anywya
04/05/2023, 15:51 - Yuen Yin Leung: so Canada and US ideal holiday would be at least 2 weeks to a month

04/05/2023, 15:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: i can't ask her directly, my mom has to do it
04/05/2023, 15:52 - Tara: Wah
04/05/2023, 15:52 - Yuen Yin Leung: cuz my mom already feels bad for my auntie buy her tickets
04/05/2023, 15:52 - Tara: True

05/05/2023, 20:49 - Tara: good balance
05/05/2023, 20:49 - Jacqueline Chan: boooo forgiveness boooooo
05/05/2023, 20:49 - Tara: she also likes keeping the peace
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: im going to tell a story to get my point across
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: (i feel like im old)
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Tara: yes grandma
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: my aunt said some very horrible things to my mom recently
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: idk if i told yall
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: one of the msgs she sent to my mom (the only one she showed me) was about how "however you (my mom) feels about our parents, is how i feel about you"
05/05/2023, 20:50 - Jacqueline Chan: my aunt is 20 years younger than my mom and 9 years younger than me
05/05/2023, 20:51 - Tara: oh dip
05/05/2023, 20:51 - Jacqueline Chan: and my mom had that typical vietnamese village childhood where she was forced to go to church 3 times a day, beaten, whipped, did chores for the whole family since she was like 5 or 6
05/05/2023, 20:51 - Jacqueline Chan: the whole schbang
05/05/2023, 20:51 - Jacqueline Chan: i think a lot of moms in my generation had a similar experience, possibly minus the religious part
05/05/2023, 20:51 - Jacqueline Chan: and my aunt knows! she knows
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: so she said that shit to my mom, who she's lived with since she was 16 or 17 til she was like, 27
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: like until she got married
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: and me la, we lived together
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: and my mom financially supported my aunt the entire time, ofc
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: cos we're better off
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: so i. came back to vn recently and my mom was like so hows ur aunt
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: (even though mom has not spoken to her since htose msgs)
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: and i was like oh i blocked her
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: and my parents were like why did you do that, why wont you keep the peace
05/05/2023, 20:52 - Jacqueline Chan: and i was like this is me keeping the peace
05/05/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: if she msgs me, which she has done before to try to get me to say something about her to my mom,
05/05/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: then ill say some very not kind things
05/05/2023, 20:53 - Jacqueline Chan: so me staying away from her is keeping the peace and maintaining the tiny string of family decency we have left
05/05/2023, 20:54 - Jacqueline Chan: which is a roundabout way of saying that i believe there are many ways to keep both external peace and inner peace, simultaneously
05/05/2023, 20:54 - Jacqueline Chan: which includes no contact or breaking off a relationship to prevent escalation
05/05/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: if you think sandy's going to do harm to you if you continue to be around her, then cut contact
05/05/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: if you think that there is a chance of working through the issue rather than having to tolerate the issue, then it might be worth going back and like
05/05/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: yknow
05/05/2023, 20:55 - Jacqueline Chan: wtv
05/05/2023, 20:59 - Tara: ok im really sorry your mom had to go through that gyad her parents 👎 sucked
05/05/2023, 20:59 - Tara: your aunt also sucks
05/05/2023, 20:59 - Tara: and yah can see why you blocked her
05/05/2023, 21:00 - Tara: it's just difficult separating what you've been brought up from what's objectively right
05/05/2023, 21:00 - Tara: i told you right
05/05/2023, 21:00 - Tara: parents are always like family first
05/05/2023, 21:00 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah
05/05/2023, 21:00 - Tara: and there was that horrible aunt who was trying to separate my mom from my uncle
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Tara: aunt as in mother's sister in law
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Tara: but the consensus now is
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Tara: we should forgive her
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Tara: we should move on
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: bruh
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Jacqueline Chan: family ties are hard
05/05/2023, 21:01 - Tara: yeah

05/05/2023, 21:02 - Tara: i have to mentally prepae myself
05/05/2023, 21:02 - Tara: for rejection
05/05/2023, 21:03 - Tara: i'll make a promise rn that if this goes south i wont try to completely block her out like i usually do with people
05/05/2023, 21:03 - Jacqueline Chan: whats the worst case scenario
05/05/2023, 21:03 - Tara: it's too late i hate you gonna turn everyone against you
05/05/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: i get why that would be ur worst case scenario
05/05/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: how likely is it going to happen
05/05/2023, 21:04 - Jacqueline Chan: and how realistically do you think she will be able to make tha thppen
05/05/2023, 21:04 - Tara: hmmm
05/05/2023, 21:04 - Tara: could she turn everyone against me
05/05/2023, 21:05 - Tara: not people i care about no
05/05/2023, 21:05 - Tara: i hope my general character will stop them from believing her
05/05/2023, 21:06 - Jacqueline Chan: its gna be okay
05/05/2023, 21:06 - Jacqueline Chan: believ ein the strength of ur connections

05/05/2023, 21:06 - Tara: i don't think it'd happen
05/05/2023, 21:06 - Tara: she didn't exactly like Siddarth when they broke up
05/05/2023, 21:07 - Tara: and guess what he's friends with everyone
05/05/2023, 21:07 - Tara: she only really talks to me and Simran about Efje
05/05/2023, 21:07 - Tara: but bruh neither of us like her

05/05/2023, 21:35 - Tara: would do
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i have read to many manhwas to think they never ever work out, and have seen too many horror stories to think they'd work out
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Tara: i don't like my friends because i know too much about them
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i like the idea of someone being stuck with me for life and forecd to see my good qualities
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Yuen Yin Leung: i feel like arrange marriages just gives u one less thing to worry about
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Jacqueline Chan: becuase i dont think people would stick around to figure them out without being forced
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Yuen Yin Leung: cuz parents are gonna find the best partner for u
05/05/2023, 21:35 - Jacqueline Chan: so that'd be good for my trauma

05/05/2023, 21:35 - Tara: i think it's good because it's like dating
but your parents approve of each other
05/05/2023, 21:36 - Tara: you don't have to marry them
05/05/2023, 21:36 - Jacqueline Chan: i think i wouldn't do it rn but if i get to a certain age and im like damn idw to be alone i'd let my parents do it
05/05/2023, 21:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: i wouldn't trust my dad to do it 💀
05/05/2023, 21:36 - Yuen Yin Leung: my mom oki
05/05/2023, 21:36 - Tara: but also i don't like arranged marriages because my parents were arranged

10/05/2023, 01:07 - Tara: @6590357204 dumb question maybe idk you tell us
10/05/2023, 01:08 - Tara: When you get into med school
Are you gonna be focusing on psychology
Or like
Physical(?) Stuff
10/05/2023, 01:08 - Tara: Body stuff
10/05/2023, 01:08 - Tara: We do not know how medical school works
10/05/2023, 01:28 - Tara: I have to become a bird watcher
10/05/2023, 01:28 - Tara: How does one become a bird watcher
10/05/2023, 01:29 - Tara: I've got binoculars
10/05/2023, 01:29 - Tara: I will buy a book
10/05/2023, 01:30 - Tara: You know what's better than birds
10/05/2023, 01:30 - Tara: Turtles
10/05/2023, 01:37 - Tara: You know how turtles lay eggs on beaches
1. How do they find them
2. How long can they hold eggs for before laying them
10/05/2023, 01:40 - Tara: It's nice how sea turtles go back to where they were born to lay their own eggs
10/05/2023, 01:40 - Tara: Full circle moment
10/05/2023, 01:40 - Tara: I guess that answers number 1
10/05/2023, 01:45 - Tara: I'm sorry guys I have Questions but no one to bother with them
10/05/2023, 01:46 - Tara: So the human eye can perceive anywhere from 100,000-1,000,000 colours
10/05/2023, 01:46 - Tara: But computers theoretically display more
10/05/2023, 01:47 - Tara: How the heck does that work
10/05/2023, 01:47 - Tara: If the computer displays [colour that we can't perceive] then what happens
Do we assign it to the closest colour we Can perceive
10/05/2023, 01:49 - Tara: Also this is unrelated but I have a tough time differentiating between blue and green sometimes
When JQ and I were finding diamonds and we saw one
I was gonna say omg it's emerald
10/05/2023, 01:49 - Tara: Kms
10/05/2023, 01:54 - Tara: Also we went to a museum once
Saw the French flag
Said omg it's the Italian flag
10/05/2023, 09:09 - Jacqueline Chan: HELP LA
10/05/2023, 09:09 - Jacqueline Chan: FUNNY
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: literally me today
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: i have to finish my lit review on ants becfore 11 so that i can go out and do the experiment prelim
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: i have no idea why they originally designed the expeirment like that
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: i got the green light from prof to change the experiment a bit
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: like i dont get it
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: theyre basically tesing whether X repels ants
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: so they put X+tuna and nothing+tuna right
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: but they put it
10/05/2023, 09:10 - Jacqueline Chan: along the path of the ants??? rather than like at the end of their path
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: so like
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: [X].          [control]
-------------------------->
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: where the arrow is direction of ant movement
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: so like how does that test for anything right
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: who designed this fr
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: so yea htheres that
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: and im also helping someone work on a project about stick insect aggression
10/05/2023, 09:11 - Jacqueline Chan: aggression over food, aggression over territory, aggression over mates
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: because their aggression thing is a bit counterintuitive so that should be fun to do
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: also the guy has never done a lit review before so i think
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: itll be cool
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: uh im just gna go to med sch first n see what sticks
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: but for now i like 1) abnormal psych, like learning developments, and 2) old people, because i like the idea of giving the elderly independence, rather than cushioning them from the possible dangers of life
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: but see how
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: uhh tbh i dont either
10/05/2023, 09:12 - Jacqueline Chan: you just go through med sch first
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: which for me is 2 years, then 1 year of research, then another year, totalling 4 years
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: and then we do some sort of general doctor exam
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: and then ballhaba
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: and only a few years after med sch do u specialise
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: from my understanding (you can tell i have research to do) you have to apply for residency (specialisation) under a dept
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: and then you kind of like fight for it lol
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: vs all the other med students who want it
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: then ure put on a waiting lsit
10/05/2023, 09:13 - Jacqueline Chan: idfk but you specialise after
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: but lots of people apply for med sch alr set on like
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: being a surgeon or something
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: which i think is insane tbh
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: could not be me
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: as in like, going into med school SURE of what u wna be
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: ykwim
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: then again i havent had many lifechanging medical experiences
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: one of my uncles is a bird watcher
10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: you just

10/05/2023, 09:14 - Jacqueline Chan: LOL
10/05/2023, 09:15 - Jacqueline Chan: i think they find them by watching the turtle lay the eggs
10/05/2023, 09:15 - Jacqueline Chan: cos i feel like itd be quite a long process right
10/05/2023, 09:15 - Jacqueline Chan: ya thats just mad
10/05/2023, 09:15 - Jacqueline Chan: also ytd i looked through this damn lit microscope ytd

10/05/2023, 11:52 - Tara: Very nice
I hope you find your niche
10/05/2023, 11:52 - Tara: You will defeat them
You are better than those dummies
10/05/2023, 11:53 - Tara: Sounds like something I would excel in
10/05/2023, 11:54 - Tara: Ya bro
I found out they can store eggs inside them for six months max
10/05/2023, 11:55 - Tara: Insanity
Computer people are insane
10/05/2023, 11:55 - Tara: Bruhhh

10/05/2023, 16:38 - Jacqueline Chan: tara could u help me rq
10/05/2023, 16:38 - Jacqueline Chan: i was trying to make a bar graph
10/05/2023, 16:38 - Jacqueline Chan: of a table that's basiclaly
10/05/2023, 16:38 - Jacqueline Chan: the columsnare : criterion, means for control (C_means), means for experimental condition (E_means)
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: where ive combined criterion, C_means, and E_means into a dataframe called Overall_means
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Tara: Sure gimme a minute
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: so i tried barplot(Overall_means)
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: and it doesnt work
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: and i want to die
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: <Media omitted>
10/05/2023, 16:39 - Jacqueline Chan: this is the error message that comes up ????

10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: ykwim
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: because the error bars / stdev for some of this is just
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: ginormous
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and then as we collect more data i can use the same code instead of having ot od it manually
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: perks of code ig
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: but im so confused ??
10/05/2023, 16:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and then i wanted to add error bars that were stdev but you know what that's a problem for later

10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: a command where you can apply one command to multiple pieces of data at once
10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: and make it into a table
10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: god kms
10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: no rush ya
10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: tbh nobody asked me to do this its just that i

10/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: LOL
10/05/2023, 16:47 - Tara: nerd
10/05/2023, 16:47 - Tara: love that for you
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: like why do it
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: a less efficient way
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: when you can do it
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: a more efficient way
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: unless the more efficient way is done by a much less efficient person
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Tara: you're a true programmer
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: sry time to go do insects i will
10/05/2023, 16:52 - Jacqueline Chan: be back
10/05/2023, 16:53 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/05/2023, 16:53 - Tara: ya bye
10/05/2023, 17:05 - Tara: Almost done
10/05/2023, 17:07 - Tara: uh
10/05/2023, 17:12 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/05/2023, 17:13 - Tara: the text size is a bit wack
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: you'd think R would automatically do that
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: but
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: i cba
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: pls
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: im losing my mind
10/05/2023, 17:14 - Tara: not because of R
10/05/2023, 17:15 - Tara: im home and there's fifty million things to do because they're cleaning out the house
10/05/2023, 17:15 - Tara: so i am getting no work done
10/05/2023, 17:30 - Tara: a couple of things about your old code
- the barplot function wasn't specifying the x and y axis properly which is why I think you had that height issue
- the line table <- table ....
should not be written because table is a reserved word
10/05/2023, 17:30 - Tara: there are a couple of words you cannot use as variable names
10/05/2023, 17:30 - Tara: like don't use a function name as a variable name
10/05/2023, 17:30 - Tara: it doesn't work
10/05/2023, 17:33 - Tara: wait i sent the wrong file
10/05/2023, 17:33 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/05/2023, 17:33 - Tara: you gotta rename these files i have two called jq
10/05/2023, 17:33 - Tara: i shall explain the loopy loop
10/05/2023, 17:35 - Tara: it goes through each of your criterions specified in overall_means (i to the length of overall_means)
it gets the data from your c_means and e_means at location i
it plots them side by side
10/05/2023, 17:38 - Tara: wait what
10/05/2023, 17:39 - Tara: how is this code working
10/05/2023, 17:44 - Tara: Jacqueline please ignore everything above
10/05/2023, 17:44 - Tara: thank you
10/05/2023, 17:51 - Tara: you know what im working on this later
10/05/2023, 17:51 - Tara: i cannot lah
10/05/2023, 17:51 - Tara: goodbye
10/05/2023, 17:53 - Tara: This is the worst I hate R
10/05/2023, 17:53 - Tara: But I will figure it out
10/05/2023, 17:53 - Tara: Later
10/05/2023, 17:58 - Tara: The problem is
10/05/2023, 17:58 - Tara: 1. It's giving me 10 different graphs
10/05/2023, 17:58 - Tara: One for each criterion
10/05/2023, 17:58 - Tara: 2. The graph is fucking tiny
10/05/2023, 17:59 - Tara: Because of no 1
10/05/2023, 17:59 - Tara: If I put everything onto one graph
The labels disappear?
10/05/2023, 17:59 - Tara: 3. For some reason R doesn't understand that 15 should not be the y limit
10/05/2023, 18:11 - Jacqueline Chan: i feel better
10/05/2023, 18:11 - Jacqueline Chan: sry heading out now

11/05/2023, 11:59 - Tara: in your courses is there ever a chapter which makes you want to give up on the entire course
11/05/2023, 11:59 - Tara: it doesn't have to be difficult
11/05/2023, 11:59 - Tara: but it's just so
11/05/2023, 11:59 - Tara: annoying
11/05/2023, 12:01 - Tara: the reason I'm behind in work is because I reached that chapter and didn't want to do anything
11/05/2023, 12:02 - Tara: ???? This is a Development
I have started
Sleep texting?
11/05/2023, 12:02 - Tara: No way
11/05/2023, 12:03 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2023, 12:03 - Tara: Hell no bro

11/05/2023, 12:05 - Tara: Wait a second I need to check what else I did then
11/05/2023, 12:08 - Tara: What did I do yesterday
11/05/2023, 12:08 - Tara: 1. Finished reading Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption
11/05/2023, 12:08 - Tara: It's only 120 pages
11/05/2023, 12:08 - Tara: Uh
11/05/2023, 12:08 - Tara: I had a dream that my dad got coronated
11/05/2023, 12:09 - Tara: And I couldn't go because I was working on a programming assignment
11/05/2023, 12:09 - Tara: Also I was working on the project in this electronics store
But there was a hole with a waterfall
So I went down and it became hyperrealistic Minecraft
And some Dude came into our server and stole my stuff
11/05/2023, 12:10 - Tara: The message wasn't "Dale joined the server"
11/05/2023, 12:10 - Tara: It was 
"Dale is watching you"
11/05/2023, 12:11 - Yuen Yin Leung: Giving same energy as herobrine
11/05/2023, 12:11 - Tara: Bruh exactly
11/05/2023, 12:11 - Tara: Horrifying
11/05/2023, 12:11 - Tara: This is more embarrassing than sleep talking
11/05/2023, 12:12 - Tara: Or it's my alternative to sleep talking because sibling isn't here to talk to
11/05/2023, 12:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: LOL
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: yyee sleep talks sometimes
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: it's so weird
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: she'll ask me questions
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: but it's incomprehensible
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Tara: Even while sleeping I can't shut up
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: so i'll be like "huh? What?"
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: and she'll get mad and go back to sleep
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Tara: I get really frustrated when sibling has no idea what I'm talking about
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Tara: Omg yeah
11/05/2023, 12:14 - Tara: You guys are useless
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Yuen Yin Leung: LmaO
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Tara: Once I asked her if my hair was nice
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Tara: Once asked her where the rice was
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Yuen Yin Leung: p o e t
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Tara: She said it was nice and I went back to sleep
11/05/2023, 12:15 - Tara: According to sibling
11/05/2023, 12:16 - Yuen Yin Leung: very nice
11/05/2023, 12:16 - Tara: It would have been funny if you were awake
11/05/2023, 12:16 - Tara: And replied
11/05/2023, 12:16 - Tara: And we had a convo
11/05/2023, 12:16 - Tara: But I swear to god
11/05/2023, 12:17 - Tara: I do not remember any of this
11/05/2023, 12:17 - Tara: This text doesn't even make sense

15/05/2023, 11:53 - Tara: So we were in our MC world
And there was this big hollow obsidian cube
And JQ and I were sitting on top of it
she jumped off and said yah food is ready let's eat
And I was too scared to jump because it was quite high and bruh heights boo
Anyway I got down somehow and I was looking into the cube and I saw this huge frikking slime from MC and I think I shot at it
Then we went to this tiny (in India it's called) dhaba which is like a tiny restaurant
And we ate lunch
Then I had to join dodgeball with my dynasty in HS
And one of the mean girls hit the ball like a golf ball and it went past the boundaries so her and this other mean girl had to go run
And they looked very funny running
Like waddling

20/05/2023, 18:47 - Jacqueline Chan: is being cisgender means that you have no problems with the gender ure in
20/05/2023, 18:47 - Jacqueline Chan: or does it mean that you strongly prefer being the gender you are
20/05/2023, 18:47 - Jacqueline Chan: or is it about like, self recognition, like responding to "she" or "he" and thinking of that as natural
20/05/2023, 18:47 - Tara: I thought cisgender just meant identifying with whatever you were assigned with at birth
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Tara: Uh
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Tara: Hmm
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Tara: Good question
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: yaa at birth
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: but like
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: if im cis
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: and i have no problem if someone calls me 'he'
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: then does that make me secure in my gender (whatever that means), or does that just come with being cis
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: or is that not cis
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: i was just thinking this cos
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: i saw some discourse on tiktok about like
20/05/2023, 18:48 - Jacqueline Chan: imean i dnt really have a right to have an opinon about it im cis but like
20/05/2023, 18:49 - Jacqueline Chan: some transgender people were saying that to transgender is to medically, to the bets of your ability, transition into a gender you weren't assigned at birth
20/05/2023, 18:49 - Jacqueline Chan: its about a medical physical transition
20/05/2023, 18:49 - Jacqueline Chan: gatekeeping being trans la basically like
20/05/2023, 18:49 - Jacqueline Chan: if you're identifying as trans you should be trying to switch
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: lets say u r a bioloiglca woman and youre like actl im a trans man, but you make no attempts to transition
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: even if you are completely able to
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: and you're out
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: and you get angry that people call you she
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: some transgender people are saying you're not trans you're just something else
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: the more i type this out the more chronically online this take sounds to me
20/05/2023, 18:50 - Jacqueline Chan: the entire thing

20/05/2023, 18:54 - Tara: I see
20/05/2023, 18:54 - Jacqueline Chan: idk i saw another video from a trans woman about how she could care less about the pronouns someone calls her, because theres so much more to her transition than just her pronouns
20/05/2023, 18:54 - Tara: You don't identify with being a man
20/05/2023, 18:54 - Jacqueline Chan: immeditaely i was like 'i do not have the right to an opinion and even if i did i would have absolutely no idea what to think'
20/05/2023, 18:54 - Jacqueline Chan: ah so its about what identify with

20/05/2023, 18:54 - Jacqueline Chan: brain. yes.
20/05/2023, 18:55 - Tara: So if you don't mind being called he but you don't identify with being a man
20/05/2023, 18:55 - Tara: Then I guess
20/05/2023, 18:55 - Tara: You're cis
20/05/2023, 18:55 - Tara: But that's a very weird hypothetical

22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: were fucked
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: because they didnt have enough food
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: so in one of the cages only 1 female sruvived, and in the ohte rcage everyone is dead or their wings are bitten off or their legs are bitten off
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: bc there were no leaves left, so they ate each other
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: which genuinel ymakes me nauseous
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: the thing is
22/05/2023, 16:46 - Jacqueline Chan: the main husbandry guy wasn't in that day he was sick
22/05/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: so me and another guy did husbandry for the adults

22/05/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: i dont rememebr aynthign
22/05/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: but its probably us two
22/05/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: because we were tgt the entire time, and i'd never do an adult cage on my own
22/05/2023, 16:47 - Jacqueline Chan: and ive only BEEN THERE THREE WEEKS
22/05/2023, 16:48 - Jacqueline Chan: but i feel so bad
22/05/2023, 16:48 - Jacqueline Chan: there's more fear than guilt
22/05/2023, 16:48 - Jacqueline Chan: because i donte ven know if i did it
22/05/2023, 16:49 - Jacqueline Chan: i cant be guilty over somethign i dont know that i did

22/05/2023, 16:51 - Jacqueline Chan: imean theres nothing we can do now, tehy're dead, and all we can do is like put more leaves and make sure it doens't happen again

22/05/2023, 17:13 - Jacqueline Chan: that i took part in killing over a weekend
22/05/2023, 17:15 - Jacqueline Chan: abig part of me is like idw to do husbandry ever again, what if i kill them again
22/05/2023, 17:16 - Jacqueline Chan: another part of me is like, no, i have to do it again, more, so that i can face mistakes and understand that i can recover from failures rather than just running away from it
22/05/2023, 17:16 - Jacqueline Chan: i dont even know
22/05/2023, 17:16 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah do it again
22/05/2023, 17:16 - Jacqueline Chan: go out a few times and see how u feel

22/05/2023, 17:25 - Yuen Yin Leung: if this was ur first time dealing with husbandry stuff ofc it's not ur fault
22/05/2023, 17:25 - Yuen Yin Leung: how did ur supervisor take it? were they made or were they juts like "oh make sure this doesn't happen again"
22/05/2023, 17:26 - Yuen Yin Leung: nO!
22/05/2023, 17:26 - Yuen Yin Leung: there's a risk that the students will mess up they know that
22/05/2023, 17:26 - Yuen Yin Leung: they wouldn't do that unless they clearly see u slacking off in lab and just being a hazard or smth
22/05/2023, 17:26 - Yuen Yin Leung: they interviewed u, they screened u and they accepted u
22/05/2023, 17:27 - Yuen Yin Leung: bestie PLS
22/05/2023, 17:28 - Jacqueline Chan: this will be my 5th time doing husbandry
22/05/2023, 17:28 - Jacqueline Chan: incrementally
22/05/2023, 17:28 - Jacqueline Chan: like gradually getting more involved each time
22/05/2023, 17:28 - Jacqueline Chan: ive never done a whole cage by myself
22/05/2023, 17:29 - Jacqueline Chan: and ive never done a cage alone
22/05/2023, 17:29 - Jacqueline Chan: which is the only thing making me feel better like
22/05/2023, 17:29 - Jacqueline Chan: its not 100% my fault
22/05/2023, 17:29 - Yuen Yin Leung: it's not ur fault yes

22/05/2023, 17:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: but they mentioned that u left early?

22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: i asked prof about that
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: levaing early is fine
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: ok then it's all good
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: they jure trying to figure out waht to do
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: u guys have more insects in lab?
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: and like realistically prof will probably just be like its okay dont freak out
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: or were they the only ones
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah there r loads

22/05/2023, 17:30 - Yuen Yin Leung: ok slay
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: im still guilty bro
22/05/2023, 17:30 - Jacqueline Chan: overpopulated
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: and there are other problems wiht husbandry
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: like it taking 12-15 man hours each time
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Yuen Yin Leung: fair fairr but yeh mistakes happen
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: on wednesdays, when theres full husbandry
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: monday and friday is half, just topping up leaves and spraying, and theres
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: thats still like 8 hours minimum of work
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: man hours ah
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: and there was mould also
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: and just
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: prof
22/05/2023, 17:31 - Jacqueline Chan: prof is not involved with insect care at all
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: like she knows how its done but she isn't involved
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: wah
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: then how would she know if it's done correctly
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: does she train u guys
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: or did ur lab mates train u
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: the other lab people
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: ??
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: whove been there
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: then
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: one year plus
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: my only saving grace is that im never alone
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Yuen Yin Leung: then i'm assuming prof wouldn't rly be too mad about it
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: I DONT EVEN REMEMBER DOING IT although im p sure if i did it went smt like
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: "do u wna do an adult cage"
22/05/2023, 17:32 - Jacqueline Chan: "hjhhsdhfh okay lets do it"
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: on one hnad
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: my lab mate asked us to use fewer leaves
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: bc the lab mate has to go collect it himself
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: and its a walk
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Yuen Yin Leung: ahh
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: so he doenst want it
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: but
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: on the other hand
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: they eat each other
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: when theyre hungry
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Jacqueline Chan: SO WHAT IS THE WORSE ALTERNATIVE REALLY
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Yuen Yin Leung: so it's pretttyyyy much the other lab mate's fault
22/05/2023, 17:33 - Yuen Yin Leung: u were just listening to their instructions
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: the main people for husandry are vera, shashi, and shyam, and rachel
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: vera breaks legs regularly
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: shashi (the leaf collector) does adults normally and eggs
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and there are problems with both adults and eggs rn
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: AND he's taken too many days off alr
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and he wants to go on a trip in a few weeks hwich he's tkaing even more days off for
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and he always goes on husbandry days
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: whcih is just death
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Yuen Yin Leung: asdkjfhlakfd
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: shyam was with me w/ the adult cages
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: even thouhg hes normally best with husbandry
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: and rachel comes in whenever she wants, and i have no idea what she does
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: so now im like
22/05/2023, 17:34 - Jacqueline Chan: yeah i know but
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Jacqueline Chan: the guilt bro
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Yuen Yin Leung: valid valid
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Jacqueline Chan: i j texted ada (one of the girls from lab)
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Jacqueline Chan: <Media omitted>
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Yuen Yin Leung: LMFAO PROF RLY NO CARE LAH
22/05/2023, 17:35 - Jacqueline Chan: vera is
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: 100% on the spectrum
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: i mean no hate but
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: the other lab interns have no idea
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: and they treat her like shes so weird
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: shes not
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: she j needs direct instructions, is very easily oversitmulated, needs a schedule, and has absolutely no filter or awareness
22/05/2023, 17:36 - Jacqueline Chan: she has been hospitalised out of stress
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: oh shit
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: wtff
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Yuen Yin Leung: oh god
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Jacqueline Chan: <Media omitted>
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Jacqueline Chan: like i think its p obvious that shes on the spectrum
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Jacqueline Chan: undiagnosed on the spectrum
22/05/2023, 17:37 - Jacqueline Chan: i try to speak to her very clearly lol
22/05/2023, 17:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: she should get diagnosed ah
22/05/2023, 17:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: our uni provides special needs stuff for exams and stuff
22/05/2023, 17:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: but they need medical proof
22/05/2023, 17:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: ALLS GOO
22/05/2023, 17:38 - Yuen Yin Leung: D
22/05/2023, 17:39 - Jacqueline Chan: no but like
22/05/2023, 17:39 - Jacqueline Chan: if you get diagnosed
22/05/2023, 17:39 - Jacqueline Chan: then sure you get some accmondations in school
22/05/2023, 17:39 - Jacqueline Chan: but in work
22/05/2023, 17:39 - Jacqueline Chan: you might hvae disadvantage
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: <Media omitted>
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: ok backstory
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: work tea fr
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: so on 8may, my first day, i met vera
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: but she went to japan for holiday for two weeks
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: so the entire time i did husbandry, i was with shashi
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: who is the main husbandry guy
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: so he talks like he knows everything
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: and is overall a v genuine person right, wtv
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: so i tohught he could do no wrong, etc.
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: even htouhg i knew there had to be a catch somewhere
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: they lways treat vera like shes brutal w husbandry
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: etc.
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: and then today i worked a lot with vera, cos shashi was sick
22/05/2023, 17:40 - Jacqueline Chan: and vera is just like
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: 'he has so many days off ah'
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and then i learnt he has max 5 days off throuhgout his entire internship, but he's alr used them ALL for sick days
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and today is his 6th
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: AND he wants to go on a trip w friends later this month or next month, and he's getting days off for that
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and he needs certain hours for his internship (its a school-mandated internship, as in he needs the hours)
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: and he insists on making up for those hours by staying late, til 7, after people leave at 6
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: but some people dont trust taht he does work for that hour
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: so they try to not have him stay late
22/05/2023, 17:41 - Jacqueline Chan: but like hwo to fix now right
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Jacqueline Chan: so anyway today i basically learnt from vera that shashi doesn't communicate where he puts his shit
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Jacqueline Chan: he j does it how he htinks it should be done
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: danm bro lab beef
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Yuen Yin Leung: yikes
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Jacqueline Chan: but vera needs certain virgin instects for experiments, like freshly adults, but he just puts them anywhere anyplace that nobody knows off
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Jacqueline Chan: of*
22/05/2023, 17:42 - Jacqueline Chan: and he's sick right
22/05/2023, 17:43 - Jacqueline Chan: vera cried in the lab today because she opened the thing n the insects were dead
22/05/2023, 17:43 - Jacqueline Chan: one of the cages
22/05/2023, 17:43 - Jacqueline Chan: the cage that they didnt eat each other, they were j dead
22/05/2023, 17:43 - Jacqueline Chan: even thouhg there were leaves, albeit half were dried
22/05/2023, 17:43 - Yuen Yin Leung: ah fuckkk :(

24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: hi so basically
24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: i think i get more work from this prof (prasad) than from the prof im under for srp (tan)
24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: <Media omitted>
24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: this is my to do list for her
24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: which i think will take like .... 4-5 hours ....
24/05/2023, 13:01 - Jacqueline Chan: and the stuff for prof tan
24/05/2023, 13:02 - Jacqueline Chan: i have to score 6 videos for aggression , possibly 9 if we end up doing three experiments today
24/05/2023, 13:02 - Jacqueline Chan: see how
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: you'd think scoring each video would tkae a long time, considering they're 1.5hrs each
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: but the insects (2 per video) don't even touch each other for like
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: 90% of the video
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: its just the last ten minutes
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: and i need to basically figure out their aggression response
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Jacqueline Chan: and the behaviours i'd like to score for
24/05/2023, 13:04 - Jacqueline Chan: and how to score, like with duration of the behaviour, or with the number of times the behaviour happens
24/05/2023, 13:04 - Jacqueline Chan: which can be confusing bc sometimes they wrestle and you're like how the fuck to quantify this bro
24/05/2023, 13:16 - Jacqueline Chan: damn the 3am wakeup time thing is hitting me
24/05/2023, 13:16 - Jacqueline Chan: my stomach go brr but i have no appetite

24/05/2023, 15:44 - Jacqueline Chan: i have decided to say fuck it to counting the exact number of times it tries to flare its mandibles and just record duration in seconds
24/05/2023, 15:44 - Jacqueline Chan: as long as it makes sense
24/05/2023, 15:44 - Jacqueline Chan: AND the aggression progression makes sense with my scoring !!! so im pleased

29/05/2023, 10:47 - Tara: Naur but I was reading the review
29/05/2023, 10:47 - Tara: And they were like
29/05/2023, 10:47 - Tara: This is a fundamental course
29/05/2023, 10:47 - Yuen Yin Leung: Ew
29/05/2023, 10:47 - Tara: All elec students should take

29/05/2023, 10:48 - Tara: Even though it's gonna be hard

29/05/2023, 10:50 - Tara: Now that's a horrible course
29/05/2023, 10:52 - Tara: Therefore, TAKE THIS COURSE if you want to do an EE master or PhD. It is possible that some PG schools will reject you RIGHT AWAY as soon as they figure out you have not taken this course or ELEC3400. If you want to do IC design (digital or analog), microelectronics or optics and photonics stream, this is even MORE likely to happen.
29/05/2023, 10:52 - Tara: Boo
29/05/2023, 10:52 - Jacqueline Chan: bruh

01/06/2023, 09:13 - Yuen Yin Leung: That has more to say about Sandy than u

01/06/2023, 09:14 - Tara: I removed Sandeepti from ma spam
01/06/2023, 09:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: If my friends had beef with each other and I’m not like

01/06/2023, 09:14 - Yuen Yin Leung: That’s it
01/06/2023, 09:15 - Tara: I think her grievance is that I was punishing her for dating Efje
01/06/2023, 09:15 - Tara: Which I suppose you can interpret from the messages
01/06/2023, 09:15 - Tara: Bruh Simran doesn't even like Efje
01/06/2023, 09:16 - Tara: Also there are two types of friends
Friends that are still friends with people you dislike
And friends that cut everyone off if their friend has an issue with someone
01/06/2023, 09:16 - Tara: Simran is the latter
01/06/2023, 09:16 - Tara: Valid
01/06/2023, 09:17 - Tara: I had a dream I was in Shenzhen

01/06/2023, 09:17 - Tara: Then I took the MTR back presumably
01/06/2023, 09:17 - Tara: But I had to choose between the purple and green line
01/06/2023, 09:18 - Tara: I was gonna say it's fine but last night I did go a bit cookoo and delete a bunch of people from my main account
01/06/2023, 09:32 - Tara: Why is my uncle sending a message on the family GC about a new car they bought as if they just had a child
