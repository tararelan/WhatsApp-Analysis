08/12/2021, 14:49 - Damien Fung: but now i go on insta and i'm getting ads for anova
08/12/2021, 14:49 - Damien Fung: except it's not stats anova bc who would want an ad about statistics

08/12/2021, 16:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Nah I checked
08/12/2021, 16:15 - Merilyn Wong: lol nice
08/12/2021, 17:28 - Tara: why do people have a 150 word limit on abstracts
08/12/2021, 17:28 - Tara: much concise
08/12/2021, 17:28 - Merilyn Wong: why say lot word when few word do trick
08/12/2021, 17:28 - Tara: 150 is a tiny paragraph
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Tara: and not proportional to the rest of the essay :(
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Tara: but i agree
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Merilyn Wong: mm how long do u want abstracts to be?
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Tara: 200-300
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Merilyn Wong: or u want it to be like 50 words per 1000 words of the essay? maybe?
08/12/2021, 17:29 - Merilyn Wong: oh
08/12/2021, 17:31 - Merilyn Wong: i want to cry from happiness, someone that graduated 12 years ago made a crash course for the module i haven't watched yet
08/12/2021, 17:31 - Patsy Ng: it's not supposed to be proportional bc it's meant to be like. a summary

if books had diff size blurbs based on their size then they wouldn't really function as blurbs
08/12/2021, 17:32 - Patsy Ng: nice
08/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: aw man the essay is only 3.6k words
08/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: hmm
08/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: quantity < quality
08/12/2021, 17:34 - Merilyn Wong: ah so my rule works
08/12/2021, 17:35 - Tara: i refuse
it will be as long as my EE
08/12/2021, 17:35 - Tara: which was definitely not 400 words btw
08/12/2021, 17:35 - Tara: it was an approximation
08/12/2021, 17:35 - Tara: true
08/12/2021, 17:35 - Tara: 4000
08/12/2021, 17:36 - Tara: im happy i now have a mouse which works on glass surfaces
08/12/2021, 17:36 - Tara: ok question do you write the abstract on the second page
08/12/2021, 17:36 - Tara: or first

08/12/2021, 18:14 - Patsy Ng: not gonna join, it's gonna be like duolingo where I grind it for a week and then forget about it

except this time the consequence is worse because the consequence is burnout
08/12/2021, 18:14 - Merilyn Wong: nah its more like a passive thing
08/12/2021, 18:14 - Tara: oh what's the group's goal
08/12/2021, 18:14 - Merilyn Wong: u just turn it on when u study and it helps u leave ur phone alone
08/12/2021, 18:14 - Tara: like 6 hours?
08/12/2021, 18:14 - Tara: 8 hours?

09/12/2021, 22:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: one thing which is fun is that I am *certain* I have some sort of disorder that causes anxiety but that I am *also* too anxious about wasting a doctor's time to get an appointment
09/12/2021, 22:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's really annoying because you have to go through a GP to see a specialist but you can also only bring up one thing at every GP consultation so I would p much have to waste a doctor's time
09/12/2021, 22:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think I will go to the university health centre over Christmas when they are less likely to have other patients with real urgent problems

09/12/2021, 22:39 - Tara: So imagine an Irish person coming up to her to say hi
09/12/2021, 22:39 - Tara: She would have to say the entire thing before saying anything else

10/12/2021, 01:19 - Patsy Ng: alright considering I revised for one (1) day

(it was the easy compsci module so I decided to cram for the other one)
10/12/2021, 01:20 - Cindy Yang: nice
10/12/2021, 01:20 - Patsy Ng: the exams include coding things and it asked us to write both the iterative and recursive ways of writing a method and I spent Ages doing the recursive one because it's a thing that should Not be done recursively Ever (but the next question was to compare them so. that's why they made us do it. but still. so awful)
10/12/2021, 01:22 - Cindy Yang: oof
10/12/2021, 03:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>

10/12/2021, 09:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Went to an "Asian fusion" restaurant for an event where they were charging £4 for three tiny siu mai
10/12/2021, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also their whole theme was selling "bao" which is such a hilariously nonspecific category of food
10/12/2021, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and it turns out
10/12/2021, 09:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They meant "an approximation of gua bao but with western bread so really it's just a hamburger with exotic fillings," instead of something fun like baozi
10/12/2021, 09:36 - Cindy Yang: yeesh
10/12/2021, 09:37 - Cindy Yang: lmao at dining hall they had basically 西红柿炒鸡蛋 and it was labelled with ‘asian inspired’ like bruh
10/12/2021, 09:37 - Damien Fung: cursed
10/12/2021, 09:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "this is our chicken katsu bao"

... This is a panko chicken hamburger. It is so white that even after I asked for the *coleslaw* to be excluded you still managed to include mayonnaise.
10/12/2021, 09:44 - Cindy Yang: hhhh
10/12/2021, 09:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also their Korean fried chicken was bright firetruck red for some reason. Like, not even glazed with reddish sauce, the batter was dyed red
10/12/2021, 09:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: also I'm pretty sure the batter was fish and chips batter bc it did not taste like fried chicken
10/12/2021, 09:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Still in shock tbh, Can you imagine paying 13 HKD for one tiny siu mai
10/12/2021, 10:07 - Tara: 13?? Scam
10/12/2021, 10:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oomf's gf has mastered 撒娇 it's hilarious

10/12/2021, 10:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: She owns him, she'll get angry at him for no reason at random times and he'll be like "I'll buy you two teddy bears"
10/12/2021, 10:07 - Tara: Also mother is in a parent teacher meeting ugh

10/12/2021, 10:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: At this point he's in so deep that all I can do is watch and marvel at this girl's skills.
10/12/2021, 10:09 - Cindy Yang: yeesh
10/12/2021, 10:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I do wish she would stop constantly calling him tho, we always end up late to class bc we walk together and he's on the phone
10/12/2021, 10:10 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo oof
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Tara: Calling people? In this day and age?
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Tara: (as if I don't call people)
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: She'll call him at random and be like "I had a dream you left me, would you ever leave me???? 😠" and he's like "bb noooo I would neverrr"
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Tara: Wat
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Tara: Ok that's weird
10/12/2021, 10:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "Who are you with rn?"
"Oh, just my classmate Martin"
"sounds like a *woman's voice* 😡"
10/12/2021, 10:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Unmatched grindset
10/12/2021, 10:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And he eats it all up, he loves it
10/12/2021, 10:12 - Tara: Are you sure she's not just a controlling dick
10/12/2021, 10:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm certain she's just doing it to be cute.
10/12/2021, 10:12 - Tara: Ok
10/12/2021, 10:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: She has no real power over him bc she's on the other side of the country
10/12/2021, 10:17 - Tara: Bruh people are throwing eggs at Maggie
10/12/2021, 10:17 - Tara: She set up that donations thing right

11/12/2021, 17:23 - Patsy Ng: I mean if you only tried to go to sleep 2 hours before a final you'd have been sleep deprived anyway
11/12/2021, 17:24 - Damien Fung: o final's in the morning
11/12/2021, 17:25 - Damien Fung: it's only 1:25 rn

11/12/2021, 18:55 - Merilyn Wong: If anyone is planning to go camping can u try casusgrill and share ur experience cos i got no one to go camping with
11/12/2021, 20:36 - Patsy Ng: what on earth is a casusgrill
11/12/2021, 20:41 - Sienna Lam: we can go camping together find some friends like from ust or hku maube
11/12/2021, 20:44 - Merilyn Wong: Its this compostable cardboard grill made by a dutch company
11/12/2021, 20:46 - Patsy Ng: wack
11/12/2021, 20:47 - Patsy Ng: how does that work tho

like. you order it as a single-use item?

wouldn't the shipping cancel out or outweigh the eco-friendliness of the compostability
11/12/2021, 21:07 - Merilyn Wong: True, but i think the disposability is appealing to people who dont intend to go camping more than once
11/12/2021, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: if it's entirely made of cardboard you could possibly reverse engineer one of your own?
11/12/2021, 21:10 - Merilyn Wong: It has a charcoal base with some firestarter substance idk what it is
11/12/2021, 21:12 - Patsy Ng: you could probably swap those fuels out for other fuels if you couldn't get those fuels

it might change the temperatures the grill can reach and what sorts of things you can cook but it would provide heat
11/12/2021, 21:19 - Merilyn Wong: Yeah but then that would be more time effort and money than just buying the thing to begin with
11/12/2021, 21:51 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
11/12/2021, 22:05 - Patsy Ng: fair

I was thinking more about decentralised production

like those people who make 3D printer designs open source so you can just Make One for yourself if there is a 3D printer available to you

12/12/2021, 01:03 - Damien Fung: like every time we try that with tree branches it barely works
12/12/2021, 01:03 - Damien Fung: so idk about small sticks
12/12/2021, 01:17 - Patsy Ng: it does work tho

12/12/2021, 01:23 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo good luck
12/12/2021, 01:24 - Damien Fung: purely for my out of control ego with this course
12/12/2021, 01:24 - Patsy Ng: p o p
12/12/2021, 01:25 - Damien Fung: still sad I'm now capped at 99.23% for the course bc of a single wrong arrow on a single UML diagram
12/12/2021, 01:25 - Patsy Ng: nooooooo
12/12/2021, 01:26 - Patsy Ng: oh my god that sucks
12/12/2021, 01:26 - Patsy Ng: what was the arrow mistake
12/12/2021, 01:26 - Cindy Yang: damn that's still real high tho
12/12/2021, 01:27 - Damien Fung: so we implemented an event logger in our project and mine was super easy to put into GIDDY
12/12/2021, 01:28 - Damien Fung: but as i was doing the UML documentation for the last step in the project i didn't realize i pointed an arrow from one of my logged classes directly to the event class instead of the event logger class
12/12/2021, 01:28 - Cindy Yang: oof
12/12/2021, 01:29 - Damien Fung: yeeee but asian 😔

13/12/2021, 08:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: New hobby: guessing which characters random Korean words are. From the translation, probably 酒令具
13/12/2021, 08:47 - Patsy Ng: ooh one of the podcasts i listen to had an episode about historical drinking games

in europe tho

basically there were special drinking cups and they were meant to be passed around 

they differed but the ones the podcast talked about had things like 
- a working! spinning! windmill! that would spin as the alcohol poured into your mouth
- pegs along the side and you had to bet on which peg you could reach in one go (and if you lost you had to pay a forfeit like buying x rounds of drinks, where x is the peg number you bet on) which is where "taken down a peg" comes from
- cups shaped like animals where women drank out of the head and men drank out of the body
13/12/2021, 08:48 - Patsy Ng: *alcoholwheel i guess

it looked like a windmill but like. it was alcohol-powered so
13/12/2021, 08:48 - Damien Fung: ooo funky
13/12/2021, 10:06 - Tara: You know how in school drills they're like
If you're in the bathroom close the door and put your feet up
13/12/2021, 10:06 - Tara: That's an interesting piece of advice given that if the doors were closed then they would know you're there anyway
13/12/2021, 10:06 - Tara: I suppose it's better than nothing though
13/12/2021, 10:30 - Merilyn Wong: learned about a bacteria called nocardia asteroids and i'll remember it forever bc it has the word asteroids
13/12/2021, 10:31 - Tara: Interesting

13/12/2021, 16:35 - Merilyn Wong: so she's basically been accepted into both the programs she applied for and now she can't choose
13/12/2021, 16:36 - Merilyn Wong: so this is BASc (Global Health and Development) but she also applied for BSc (Food and Nutrition)

13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: you know how when we had to rehearse for the year 4 play
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: whenever she would be teaching us the choreography
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: i would do the opposite move
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: because i was being a prick
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: like if her hand swung to the left
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: her left
13/12/2021, 23:32 - Tara: our right
13/12/2021, 23:33 - Tara: then i would swing my hand to the left
13/12/2021, 23:33 - Tara: it's a miracle none of the teachers said anything
13/12/2021, 23:33 - Tara: k goodnight
13/12/2021, 23:34 - Merilyn Wong: Lmaooooo
13/12/2021, 23:34 - Merilyn Wong: "I was an asshole long before i knew what the word meant"

- white emperor
-colour
-cloud
-space/location/room?
14/12/2021, 01:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No idea
14/12/2021, 01:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay it's a poetry excerpt
14/12/2021, 01:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: White emperor is apparently a location
14/12/2021, 01:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like, it's about how a guy leaves white emperor city in the early morning, when the clouds are still colourful from the sunrise
14/12/2021, 01:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And the rest of the poem describes his journey
14/12/2021, 01:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 李白 is a famous tang dynasty poet but idk any of his works except Jing Ye Si
14/12/2021, 01:37 - Rishibh Prakash: ok but i dont understand is why the author would put this at the beginning of a math textbook
14/12/2021, 01:37 - Rishibh Prakash: <Media omitted>
14/12/2021, 01:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe it's symbolic of you beginning a new journey in algebra
14/12/2021, 01:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, you're setting off and experiencing new things + it's a metaphorical dawn
14/12/2021, 01:38 - Rishibh Prakash: ah true
14/12/2021, 01:38 - Rishibh Prakash: you know what, i will accept that
14/12/2021, 01:47 - Cindy Yang: nice
14/12/2021, 01:50 - Cindy Yang: do u guys like. forget u can take medicine
14/12/2021, 01:51 - Cindy Yang: so like me duele la cabeza yesterday and i mentioned it to my roommate and she was like oh do you want some advil and i was like oh yea. u can take medicine for headaches
14/12/2021, 01:53 - Cindy Yang: i forget that painkillers are a thing
14/12/2021, 01:56 - Patsy Ng: oh definitely
14/12/2021, 01:57 - Rishibh Prakash: usually if im uncomfortable, i forget that i can do things to change that and instead just try to push through

like if im cold, it wont even occur to me to put on a jacket or turn up the heating. instead, i'll just say to myself, guess i just gotta deal with being cold
14/12/2021, 01:58 - Cindy Yang: yea it do be like that
14/12/2021, 01:58 - Cindy Yang: not so much for cold for me tho
14/12/2021, 01:58 - Cindy Yang: but def pain
14/12/2021, 02:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah all the time
14/12/2021, 02:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Even at home I was always like "no I'm sure everything will be fine, I don't neeeeeed a pill"
14/12/2021, 02:08 - Cindy Yang: mm
14/12/2021, 02:08 - Cindy Yang: yea
14/12/2021, 02:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or like, when I have a sore throat, a stuffy nose, whatever, I'm like "okay I will have a hot drink" which helps for like, five minutes and then I'm like 'oh no I tried everything, guess I will just die'
14/12/2021, 02:09 - Damien Fung: mood
14/12/2021, 02:11 - Damien Fung: like isabel's mom told me to get these insomnia pills but i keep on forgetting abd everytime i have insomnia I'm like "hmmm am i desperate enough to whip out the alcohol"
14/12/2021, 02:11 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo oof
14/12/2021, 02:15 - Patsy Ng: has the answer ever been yes
14/12/2021, 02:15 - Damien Fung: thrice
14/12/2021, 02:15 - Patsy Ng: wow
14/12/2021, 02:16 - Damien Fung: wait no twice
14/12/2021, 02:16 - Damien Fung: last year to reset my sleep schedule for my 4am exams
14/12/2021, 02:17 - Damien Fung: and a few months ago to wake up in 4 hours for a camera swap
14/12/2021, 02:17 - Cindy Yang: damb
14/12/2021, 03:08 - Damien Fung: https://youtu.be/DlUyHogoyvE
14/12/2021, 03:08 - Damien Fung: a real sad boi
14/12/2021, 03:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which insomnia pills lol
14/12/2021, 03:18 - Damien Fung: gravol
14/12/2021, 03:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Usually I have to decide whether or not it's worth switching on the lights and making a mug of chamomile tea
14/12/2021, 03:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because like, it's really good for insomnia but also that's sacrificing like an hour to make it and wait for it to take effect
14/12/2021, 03:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And like, if I could have gotten to sleep in that hour I'm wasting time, but also if I end up giving up and having to make the tea later that also wastes tims
14/12/2021, 03:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: *time
14/12/2021, 03:24 - Cindy Yang: rip
14/12/2021, 03:25 - Patsy Ng: preemptively make chamomile tea
14/12/2021, 03:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah this seems the way to go
14/12/2021, 03:26 - Damien Fung: iced chamomile tea
14/12/2021, 03:26 - Damien Fung: keep it in your fridge indefinitely
14/12/2021, 03:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Might start keeping a flask at the ready for when I need it
14/12/2021, 03:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But then I'd *have* to drink it
14/12/2021, 03:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh that reminds me I have cold brew tea waiting for me in the fridge
14/12/2021, 03:27 - Damien Fung: oooo
14/12/2021, 03:31 - Cindy Yang: nice
14/12/2021, 03:40 - Cindy Yang: agh forgot my keys again today after forgetting them yesterday

14/12/2021, 04:03 - Cindy Yang: good luck
14/12/2021, 04:03 - Cindy Yang: do y’all get tonsil stones
14/12/2021, 04:03 - Patsy Ng: what on earth are those
14/12/2021, 04:03 - Cindy Yang: stones on ur tonsils
14/12/2021, 04:04 - Cindy Yang: lmao nah it’s like, white bits on ur tonsils that build up
14/12/2021, 04:05 - Patsy Ng: huh ok no then
14/12/2021, 04:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like strep throat?
14/12/2021, 04:06 - Cindy Yang: no
14/12/2021, 04:07 - Cindy Yang: like cos ur tonsils got little pits and bacteria and stuff can build up in there and calcify into tonsil stones
14/12/2021, 04:07 - Cindy Yang: it’s usually not noticeable
14/12/2021, 04:08 - Cindy Yang: if it gets a bit bigger it feels a bit like a sore throat
14/12/2021, 07:06 - Merilyn Wong: Peritonsillar abscess
14/12/2021, 07:06 - Merilyn Wong: Idk
14/12/2021, 07:06 - Merilyn Wong: Ouch
14/12/2021, 08:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>

14/12/2021, 08:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, I hated my essay so much that I was certain it would get like 20%
14/12/2021, 08:11 - Merilyn Wong: U are a good writerrrrr
14/12/2021, 08:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But I got around 70% and it outscored my actually good essay for another module
14/12/2021, 08:11 - Merilyn Wong: Yeaaaaaaaaaa
14/12/2021, 08:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think I just dazzled the marker with a good enough pun that they moved me up a bit lol

14/12/2021, 08:33 - Patsy Ng: nice
14/12/2021, 08:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: V funny how when somebody asks me to speak Chinese irl I freeze up, but when I'm texting my mum asking for more money suddenly I am 🇨🇳fluent🇨🇳
14/12/2021, 08:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Basically I am buying a bunch of train tickets and such tomorrow and since I have to pay for all my transport stuff, travel related expenses, Christmas presents, etc up front for all the way until early January I have to come crawling back to my parents like "if you plan on sending me Christmas money can you send it now so that I can stop stressing about how I will survive the 20th to the 25th + also not have to worry about going broke on my way up to Scotland"
14/12/2021, 08:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And I think maybe if I do it in mandarin she will be too busy translating what I am saying to have an emotional reaction to me asking for cash
14/12/2021, 08:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "thank you for the tea you sent me! It looks so expensive! Btw, can you send me money? I promise it's nbd but also can you please do it so I feel safer? Again it's probably fine but juuuuuust in case"
14/12/2021, 08:59 - Merilyn Wong: :)

15/12/2021, 13:22 - Damien Fung: it was autograded so i found out i'm right on the mean
15/12/2021, 13:22 - Damien Fung: but apart from that it wasn't half bad
15/12/2021, 13:22 - Damien Fung: however
15/12/2021, 13:23 - Damien Fung: since we have like 300 people in the section and the exam hall that was actually our lecture hall has a capacity of 300 people anyone who came in late wasn't able to find the remaining seats hidden between the crowd of people
15/12/2021, 13:23 - Damien Fung: so there were some people sitting on the stairs
15/12/2021, 13:23 - Merilyn Wong: Bruh

15/12/2021, 13:27 - Merilyn Wong: Initially they were going to have us use our own but they found out that Macs have a thesaurus function that would still work with the exam software so then they had to supply the computers
15/12/2021, 13:27 - Damien Fung: lmaoooooo
15/12/2021, 13:27 - Damien Fung: do they not have invigilators?
15/12/2021, 13:27 - Merilyn Wong: We only have 1 exam so it's a huge deal and there's so many invigilators

16/12/2021, 21:53 - Rishibh Prakash: You how you can do 1.5 hours to mean 1 hours and 30 mins

In theory you could do the same thing to refer to what proportion of the year we've been through. Today being the 350th day of the year, you could also call it 2021.959
16/12/2021, 21:54 - Tara: i could but also i'm just talking about yearly data
16/12/2021, 22:00 - Tara: i hate word so much why do you gotta move all my graphs around when i just want to move a _frikking_ textbox why are you like this

17/12/2021, 01:56 - Merilyn Wong: Yeah but they only changed it in some countries

17/12/2021, 15:16 - Tara: Which is really funny
17/12/2021, 15:17 - Damien Fung: lmaooooo
17/12/2021, 15:19 - Tara: Scary as in like
17/12/2021, 15:19 - Tara: Lemme show you our first conversation

17/12/2021, 15:22 - Damien Fung: intersante
17/12/2021, 15:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 15:23 - Tara: So two things to take from this
17/12/2021, 15:23 - Tara: Use haha / lol / exclamation marks
Don't say ok
17/12/2021, 15:24 - Tara: 🦀🦀🦀
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Tara: Actually nothing's changed
She says she finds me scarier than her mother
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Sienna Lam: I got banned from a discord because I said ok
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Tara: Hein
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Tara: Why
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Cindy Yang: ??
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Tara: Ok is a perfectly ok thing to say
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Tara: It's not hostile
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo bruh
17/12/2021, 15:25 - Sienna Lam: They were trolls
17/12/2021, 15:26 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 15:46 - Damien Fung: tara the mafia boss
17/12/2021, 15:49 - Merilyn Wong: How to make ur texting tone friendlier:

Exclamation marks
Improper grammar
Adding extra letters
Normie emojis
Normie whatsapp stickers
Say ahaha instead of lol
Abbreviate when possible
17/12/2021, 15:51 - Tara: 🤮
17/12/2021, 15:51 - Tara: Ugh
17/12/2021, 15:51 - Tara: Fine
17/12/2021, 15:51 - Tara: Will do this
17/12/2021, 15:52 - Merilyn Wong: Ahahaha ok! Sounds great 👍😁
17/12/2021, 15:52 - Merilyn Wong: My schoolsona
17/12/2021, 15:52 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
17/12/2021, 15:53 - Cindy Yang: y'all so i guess i'm alone in this dorm for break lol
17/12/2021, 15:53 - Merilyn Wong: Send pics
17/12/2021, 15:54 - Damien Fung: ah no fear of roommate walkin in huh
17/12/2021, 15:54 - Damien Fung: i just say stuff like "sweet! see you there!"
17/12/2021, 15:54 - Damien Fung: or "sounds good! will do!"
17/12/2021, 15:55 - Cindy Yang: :/
17/12/2021, 15:55 - Merilyn Wong: Fun idea: for the next 5 minutes text like you're speaking with your classmates
17/12/2021, 15:55 - Damien Fung: ok!
17/12/2021, 15:55 - Cindy Yang: Sure, I can do that
17/12/2021, 15:56 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 15:56 - Merilyn Wong: Oh no! I hope everything is ok 💕💕
17/12/2021, 15:56 - Damien Fung: yeah! you can survive the break!!!
17/12/2021, 15:57 - Cindy Yang: Haha thanks, I'll be fine ☺️
17/12/2021, 15:57 - Merilyn Wong: 😁😁 good to hear
17/12/2021, 15:58 - Merilyn Wong: How is everybody's semester break so far!
17/12/2021, 15:58 - Cindy Yang: Still working on my last paper due tomorrow 😅 But it's been good so far! Hbu?
17/12/2021, 15:58 - Damien Fung: I'm so comfy it feels like I'm sitting on a bag of rocks!
17/12/2021, 15:59 - Damien Fung: beanbag of rocks*
17/12/2021, 15:59 - Merilyn Wong: I've also been doing good! 🥰 Just had a good lunch 😋😋
17/12/2021, 16:00 - Damien Fung: what are your plans for winter break? I'm gonna be doing a bunch of photography!!!
17/12/2021, 16:00 - Damien Fung: ok times up back to normal y'all
17/12/2021, 16:00 - Damien Fung: freedom
17/12/2021, 16:00 - Merilyn Wong: Yeet
17/12/2021, 16:00 - Tara: I- your classmates are so happy
17/12/2021, 16:01 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Damien Fung: oo someone remind me to make a portfolio website over the break
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Merilyn Wong: Ok
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Damien Fung: gotta pump one out before co-op applications start
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Merilyn Wong: Oo
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Merilyn Wong: Wish u hadnt used those words but the sentiment stands
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Tara: Omg I'm gonna make a digital portfolio too
17/12/2021, 16:02 - Damien Fung: based
17/12/2021, 16:03 - Tara: I've been told to add school assignments too
17/12/2021, 16:03 - Damien Fung: took me a second before the word combo reached my brain
17/12/2021, 16:03 - Sienna Lam: (d) Doesthereexista3×3matrixAwith(A−I)(A−2I)(A−3I)=0which is not diagonalisable? If there does, produce an example. Otherwise, give a short explanation for why no such matrix exists.
Solution:
Assume A is a 3-by-3 matrix with (A − I)(A − 2I)(A − 3I) = 0.
If 1, 2, and 3 are all eigenvalues of A then A is diagonalisable.
Recall that λ is not an eigenvalue if and only if A − λI is invertible. If exactly one of the numbers λ ∈ {1, 2, 3} is an eigenvalue then A−μI would be invertible for the other two numbers μ ∈ {1, 2, 3}, so we could cancel factors in the equation
(A−I)(A−2I)(A−3I) = 0
to deduce that A − λI = 0, and hence that A = λI is diagonal and diago-
nalisable.
The final case to consider is that exactly two numbers λ, μ ∈ {1, 2, 3} are eigenvalues. It would then follow as in the previous paragraph that (A − λI)(A − μI) = 0. The only way that A could fail to be diagonalisable is if the eigenspaces of λ and μ both have dimension one. In this event, we would have dim Nul(A−λI) = dim Nul(A−μI) = 1 and dim Col(A−λI) = dim Col(A − μI ) = 2 by the rank-nullity theorem. But the only way we can have(A−λI)(A−μI) = 0isifCol(A−μI) ⊂ Nul(A−λI),whichis impossible if dim Nul(A − λI ) < dim Col(A − μI ).
We conclude that A must be diagonalisable.
17/12/2021, 16:03 - Damien Fung: tbh my uni projects are really boring in comparison to what I've done on my own
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Tara: Yeah they are boring
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Tara: But it's still a coding assignment
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Cindy Yang: just gotta rub one out before
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Damien Fung: like building a java app is nothing compared to what E.A.S.E and my person tracker achieved
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Cindy Yang: nice
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Damien Fung: wait not ease
17/12/2021, 16:04 - Damien Fung: NAVI
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Cindy Yang: ain't that the avatar ppl
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Damien Fung: also i have decided to not name my next project H.I.M.B.O
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Tara: Sid hath inspired me 
I want to do something with NLP
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Tara: Next
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Cindy Yang: damn
17/12/2021, 16:05 - Cindy Yang: what r u namin it
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Damien Fung: just gonna go with smth boring like badminton pose recognition analysis or smth
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Damien Fung: 👀
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Tara: Oh did I tell you
I've finished my finance project
Submitted it
He mispelt my surname so I need to email him
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Damien Fung: F
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Tara: Renlan
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Tara: Ugh
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Tara: Your projects are inspiring
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Tara: I want to do cool shit now
17/12/2021, 16:06 - Damien Fung: oh did you use time series?
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Tara: Oui
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Damien Fung: ooooo how'd it go
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Damien Fung: apparently it's crucial to statistics but I only learn it in 4th year
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Tara: I don't think it's that difficult
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Tara: It was good
17/12/2021, 16:07 - Damien Fung: instersante
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Tara: Returns were aight
It generally outperformed buy and hold
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Damien Fung: oooo
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Tara: Dunno how much you know about finance
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Damien Fung: none at all
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Tara: But buy and hold is just
You buy a stock 
Hold it for a very long time
Then sell it
17/12/2021, 16:08 - Damien Fung: ahh yeah that i know
17/12/2021, 16:09 - Tara: I tried a pairs trading strategy to compare
17/12/2021, 16:09 - Tara: You use the moving average and standard deviation to see when to buy and sell
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Tara: Buy when the spread is greater than 2*std+moving average
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Damien Fung: oh forgot to mention that i might not even use pose recognition that much in my algorithm

might just draw some vectors on the shuttlecock trajectory to determine what moves were used in a game
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Tara: Sell when the spread is less than MA-2*std
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Tara: Bollinger bands
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Tara: Ooh wow
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Tara: Good luck
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Damien Fung: wait 2 SDs?
17/12/2021, 16:10 - Damien Fung: that's a huge margin of error tho
17/12/2021, 16:11 - Tara: It's apparently the standard
17/12/2021, 16:11 - Tara: Anything higher then the upper and lower bands don't intersect the moving average
17/12/2021, 16:11 - Damien Fung: i mean yeah 95 confidence interval
17/12/2021, 16:11 - Tara: Lower idk
There'll be way more trading days
17/12/2021, 17:33 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: Ok but like some of the books we have were borrowed from A Library
17/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: Presumably from mother's school
17/12/2021, 17:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>

17/12/2021, 18:16 - Patsy Ng: groovy
17/12/2021, 18:16 - Merilyn Wong: Not sure tho
17/12/2021, 18:16 - Patsy Ng: nah it looks good
17/12/2021, 18:16 - Merilyn Wong: 13d snuggery/s
17/12/2021, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: it might be that actually
17/12/2021, 18:17 - Merilyn Wong: 21a mine i think
17/12/2021, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: ohhhh that's what colliery means
17/12/2021, 18:17 - Merilyn Wong: Idk
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Merilyn Wong: I think its cryptic
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Merilyn Wong: So i used the brackets
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: in hindsight i should have realized that from the thumb biting joke in romeo and juliet
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Merilyn Wong: Oh
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: the colliers line
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Merilyn Wong: I forget it, can u refresh my memery
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: blah blah "for then we should be _colliers_"
17/12/2021, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: i'll look it up
17/12/2021, 18:19 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: the only reason i remember this is bc none of us got in in class so you read it out with a very forced laugh afterwards
17/12/2021, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: anyway 15 acumen
17/12/2021, 18:21 - Merilyn Wong: Lmao
17/12/2021, 18:21 - Merilyn Wong: Glad my assholery can be of service
17/12/2021, 18:22 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 18:26 - Merilyn Wong: Im so deeply disturbed
17/12/2021, 18:27 - Merilyn Wong: Im also at this random meeting and they didnt put a location in the email
17/12/2021, 18:27 - Merilyn Wong: So i think no one else is coming
17/12/2021, 18:27 - Patsy Ng: she's just a happy cow with a beautiful smile
17/12/2021, 18:27 - Merilyn Wong: Yes gorgeous
17/12/2021, 18:27 - Patsy Ng: oof
17/12/2021, 18:28 - Merilyn Wong: Could 22 be tornadoed
17/12/2021, 18:31 - Patsy Ng: hmm could slap it in
17/12/2021, 18:31 - Patsy Ng: wait no
17/12/2021, 18:31 - Patsy Ng: it's a ltter too long
17/12/2021, 18:31 - Patsy Ng: *letter
17/12/2021, 18:31 - Merilyn Wong: Damnb
17/12/2021, 18:46 - Patsy Ng: hmm could 10 be backtalker??
17/12/2021, 18:57 - Tara: Found a copy of the Incredibles in the case of the Shawshank redemption
17/12/2021, 18:57 - Tara: Bro I bet my sister stuck it in there so I wouldn't watch it
17/12/2021, 18:57 - Tara: I used to force her to watch it with me
17/12/2021, 18:57 - Tara: Like daily
17/12/2021, 19:14 - Merilyn Wong: Oo
17/12/2021, 19:14 - Merilyn Wong: Hehehehe
17/12/2021, 19:41 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 19:41 - Tara: Shenme*
17/12/2021, 19:44 - Merilyn Wong: Burn it

17/12/2021, 20:12 - Tara: Oooh damn girl
17/12/2021, 20:12 - Tara: Nice
17/12/2021, 20:13 - Patsy Ng: nice
17/12/2021, 20:15 - Patsy Ng: watching the swan videos i took yesterday and they're all super funny bc i could only use one hand to hold the camera bc feeding with the other hand, so everything was unintentionally filmed at a dutch angle

the winter sky is also very dull grey and it just makes for an unnecessarily edgy vibe
17/12/2021, 20:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sinister
17/12/2021, 20:41 - Merilyn Wong: Dayummmmm
17/12/2021, 20:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 20:45 - Merilyn Wong: Nice
17/12/2021, 20:46 - Tara: Small issue though
17/12/2021, 20:46 - Tara: Joystick doesn't work
17/12/2021, 20:53 - Tara: Aaaa it works
17/12/2021, 20:55 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah @447380604852 I got my booster covid jab yesterday and they counted it as a booster so hk vaccinations count
17/12/2021, 20:57 - Tara: Sounds like it's dying
17/12/2021, 20:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: based
17/12/2021, 20:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Did you have to bring proof of vax
17/12/2021, 21:08 - Tara: y'all on spotify
17/12/2021, 21:08 - Tara: have your friends disappeared
17/12/2021, 21:14 - Tara: @14379874097 hey do you mind if i see your website
17/12/2021, 21:31 - Rishibh Prakash: Course not, go for it
17/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: i mean could you send the link again pls
17/12/2021, 21:32 - Rishibh Prakash: It needs some major revamping anyway
17/12/2021, 21:32 - Rishibh Prakash: Ah lol
17/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: big thank
17/12/2021, 21:33 - Rishibh Prakash: https://individual.utoronto.ca/rishibhp/
17/12/2021, 21:33 - Rishibh Prakash: Lol I was wondering why you were asking for my permission
17/12/2021, 21:39 - Patsy Ng: yeah but just the leave home safe thing counted
17/12/2021, 21:41 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/12/2021, 21:42 - Tara: my mind hath gone blank
17/12/2021, 21:43 - Tara: how does one create a portfolio
17/12/2021, 21:49 - Tara: is there no \t in html
17/12/2021, 21:58 - Rishibh Prakash: Probably easiest to start with things that you want to include on the site
17/12/2021, 21:58 - Rishibh Prakash: You can decide on the words later
17/12/2021, 21:59 - Tara: im looking at your site for inspiration ha
17/12/2021, 21:59 - Tara: this shall be my winter project
17/12/2021, 22:02 - Rishibh Prakash: Funnily enough my winter project is to update my page as well
17/12/2021, 22:02 - Tara: omg twinsies
17/12/2021, 22:02 - Rishibh Prakash: I kind of want to include everything I've worked on up there
17/12/2021, 22:02 - Tara: im adding like all my coursework that ive gotten high marks on
17/12/2021, 22:03 - Tara: ooh my data visualisation project
17/12/2021, 22:03 - Tara: i will add that
17/12/2021, 22:03 - Tara: ~which is everything~
17/12/2021, 22:06 - Rishibh Prakash: I also want to include some of the notes I've created for classes, some questions/worksheets I created for my study group and some more math visualisations I made for topology (this time in math3d instead of desmos)
17/12/2021, 22:06 - Tara: ooh interesting
17/12/2021, 22:06 - Tara: can we see the math3d stuff 👉👈
17/12/2021, 22:07 - Merilyn Wong: 😜😜
17/12/2021, 22:07 - Tara: stawp
17/12/2021, 22:07 - Rishibh Prakash: I will send that soon
17/12/2021, 22:08 - Rishibh Prakash: Gotta to have breakfast now
17/12/2021, 22:08 - Tara: enjoy
17/12/2021, 22:09 - Rishibh Prakash: In the mean time if these words make sense, you can try and answer the question as to why the fundamental group of a torus is abelian
17/12/2021, 22:10 - Tara: i know nothing of topology
17/12/2021, 22:10 - Tara: so i will read articles
17/12/2021, 22:10 - Tara: and try to piece it together
17/12/2021, 22:26 - Tara: ok i think i get it
17/12/2021, 22:26 - Tara: animations are bae
17/12/2021, 22:30 - Rishibh Prakash: here is my "proof" for why the fundamental group of a torus is abelian
17/12/2021, 22:31 - Rishibh Prakash: https://www.math3d.org/5oAr1Kb17
17/12/2021, 22:31 - Rishibh Prakash: wait no thats bad one
17/12/2021, 22:31 - Tara: oooh yes i saw this animation
17/12/2021, 22:31 - Tara: oh lawd
17/12/2021, 22:32 - Rishibh Prakash: https://www.math3d.org/02K6NBQMf
17/12/2021, 22:32 - Tara: which do you prefer
17/12/2021, 22:32 - Rishibh Prakash: its also quite fun if you remove the torus itself
17/12/2021, 22:32 - Tara: desmos or math3d
17/12/2021, 22:32 - Rishibh Prakash: 100% desmos
17/12/2021, 22:33 - Rishibh Prakash: much cleaner and nicer and math3d has some weird bugs sometimes
17/12/2021, 22:33 - Rishibh Prakash: however
17/12/2021, 22:34 - Rishibh Prakash: i have math3d to be a lot faster and they do some things that i think desmos should really look into
17/12/2021, 22:35 - Rishibh Prakash: like you can use a function to colour in a surface which is useful when trying to highlight something
18/12/2021, 01:32 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
18/12/2021, 01:33 - Cindy Yang: very nice
18/12/2021, 01:34 - Cindy Yang: so i went to the housing office and asked if anyone was staying in the same apartment as me and they were like yea but the thing is they can just come and leave whenever so we can't guarantee
18/12/2021, 01:35 - Cindy Yang: wait did i mention that this apartment that i'm staying in is like. other ppl's dorm apartment

19/12/2021, 11:22 - Tara: Ugh sorry
It's just that the UST people don't make an effort to actually put names to faces and it's really annoying
19/12/2021, 11:22 - Tara: Like friend there are four Indian guys how difficult is it to remember their names
19/12/2021, 11:27 - Patsy Ng: idk everyone got paler over covid due to staying indoors more

27/12/2021, 00:38 - Rishibh Prakash: If you have free time, you can help contribute to wikisource which is a project to digitise old books (_source_ material) to make them freely available: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page. 
It's super easy: you can transcribe scanned pages of books which mostly just involves fixing the OCR or you can validate other people's transcriptions (if you're feeling wild you can do both). You also get to feel all warm and fuzzy from contributing in exactly what it is that makes the internet so great, the free sharing of knowledge
27/12/2021, 00:39 - Rishibh Prakash: you can also look at some of the other wiki projects, you might find something else that catches your interest

02/01/2022, 16:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Comrade dog
02/01/2022, 16:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Based dog enforcing platonic activities
02/01/2022, 16:59 - Sienna Lam: ^

02/01/2022, 21:54 - Tara: opinions pls

02/01/2022, 21:54 - Tara: weird or not
02/01/2022, 21:54 - Tara: You deleted this message
02/01/2022, 21:54 - Tara: if it's a good idea or just highly pretentious
02/01/2022, 21:55 - Tara: You deleted this message
02/01/2022, 22:10 - Tara: Omg also when Rasputin glided into the palace for the party I thought oh huh imagine if he was on a hoverboard
02/01/2022, 22:21 - Patsy Ng: ?
02/01/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Website with links to stuff you want for your bday
02/01/2022, 23:07 - Merilyn Wong: Mm its tricky cos if ur close enough w them to send a registry list then they shd alr know what u want kinda
02/01/2022, 23:16 - Sienna Lam: This message was deleted
03/01/2022, 08:16 - Tara: You deleted this message
03/01/2022, 08:16 - Tara: You deleted this message
03/01/2022, 08:21 - Tara: But why not just tell people what you want
03/01/2022, 08:21 - Tara: And get those things instead
03/01/2022, 08:54 - Tara: Well both work I guess if you're confident enough
03/01/2022, 08:57 - Rishibh Prakash: you could have something like, "hey if you don't know what to get me, here's a list"
03/01/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: get what you're saying but also if you think less of them for not knowing what you want then you're not as close as you think you are

so you might as well make it easier for everyone by giving them a sort of guideline

like maybe a gift type like "cooking item" or "board game" and then they have to narrow it down to sth you would like
03/01/2022, 08:59 - Patsy Ng: so that's more like both people making an effort

giver has to put in effort to narrow down gift

06/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Go to Princeton
06/01/2022, 23:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: Perhaps
06/01/2022, 23:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: But
06/01/2022, 23:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: I don’t even know if he likes me lol

06/01/2022, 23:19 - Tanushree Banerjee: Why do you think so
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Patsy Ng: created a google group so we don't have to share emails all the time
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Patsy Ng: if i missed you out it means i don't have your email
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Tanushree Banerjee: Tb21@princeton.edu
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Because he said so right
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Like you heard from another person
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Patsy Ng: i memorized char's and martin's so they're on already
06/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: That he does like you

06/01/2022, 23:20 - Tanushree Banerjee: And khush chapter is over
06/01/2022, 23:20 - Tanushree Banerjee: Bc I told khush I’m not interested
06/01/2022, 23:20 - Tanushree Banerjee: Also
06/01/2022, 23:20 - Tanushree Banerjee: It was kinda obvious those two had dissected my date with khush tho
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: Ohhhh Jammu and Kashmir
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: Bc Arya knew everything I told khush
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: Got it my bad
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: I got them mixed up
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: Khush liked me
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: I like Arya
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: Arya BFF with khush
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: But I told khush I’m not interested
06/01/2022, 23:21 - Tanushree Banerjee: Khush was dumb enough to tell Noyna that he is not sure whether I am into him
06/01/2022, 23:22 - Tanushree Banerjee: But thought I enjoyed
06/01/2022, 23:22 - Tanushree Banerjee: Noyna is my friend
06/01/2022, 23:22 - Tanushree Banerjee: And Arya was dumb enough to make it obvious that he knew everything I told khush basically
06/01/2022, 23:22 - Tanushree Banerjee: Ok
06/01/2022, 23:23 - Tanushree Banerjee: See it’s a messed up stupid situation
06/01/2022, 23:23 - Tanushree Banerjee: Point is
06/01/2022, 23:23 - Tanushree Banerjee: Doesn’t matter Bc I go to Pton in two weeks
06/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: Not really
You can close the Jammu chapter since you're not into him
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Done already lah
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: K so there's only one person left
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Not a huge mess
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Ye
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: every time you type "khush" i think of the land of kush, aka the ancient civilization
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Well since he's told you he knows
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: What
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Hmm
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: One minute
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Khush situation?
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: I think
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Yes
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Obviously
06/01/2022, 23:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: They are best friends
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Which means Arya in principle cannot like me
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: ?
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Oh he can
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Khush liked me
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: He definitely can
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: as in the besties don't crush on their bestie's crush?
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: If Arya doesn't like you simply because his friend does
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Ye
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: That's idiocy
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: You don't have a monopoly
06/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Be selfish sometimes
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol also Arya probably just wants to be friends
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: If it doesn't work with Khush then he should just cut his losses and move ok
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: On
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: He also sent me his guitar videos lol
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: Well it hasn't so
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: No khush was kinda nice about it
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: Yeah that's fine
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: I feel bad tho
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: For khush
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: Bc this happened
06/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: I'm just saying that Arya may like you
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: And I think
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: If he comes to campus then ask him out
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: If you want
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: <Media omitted>
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: <Media omitted>
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: Yay
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: Not at all on principle I do nothing
06/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: Moving on
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: I always mess it up if I do
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Girlie who have you asked out
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol ansh kinda? Implicitly?
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Yes but that's one guy
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: But he’s a trash guy anyway
06/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: That too
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: I heard another sketchy story about him
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: Also I think there’s some value in playing hard to get
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: You going back to campus is probably the height of playing hard to get
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Not exactly playing
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Actually being hard to get
06/01/2022, 23:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: I mean I’m not going to drop out if Pton am I
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: Ja true
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: But
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: But
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tanushree Banerjee: Uh whatever he doesn’t completely hate me if he wants to get food w me again
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: If you don't do anything and he doesn't do anything then won't you regret it
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tanushree Banerjee: And had. A twi hour coffee w me
06/01/2022, 23:30 - Tanushree Banerjee: Point is

06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: Aight
06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tanushree Banerjee: I just want him to ask me to go try out the food place he said he wanted to try out w meeee
06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol
06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tanushree Banerjee: I also owe him coffee so I feel bad
06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: Ugh girl please
06/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: This is a tragedy
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tanushree Banerjee: Why
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tanushree Banerjee: He also spoke to me right after he submitted his last college apppppppo
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tanushree Banerjee: Isn’t that
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tanushree Banerjee: Cuteeeee
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: You're like ugh I wish xyz but you could literally be the one who initiates it
06/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: Don't be passive

07/01/2022, 01:29 - Patsy Ng: https://youtu.be/C6YMNOyKwIg
07/01/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Square by Baek Yerin is the really annoying combo of:

- in my vocal range
- really catchy power ballad
- absolutely terrible grammar, embarrassing to sing along to
07/01/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "would you want me in bae" girl what the fuck are you talking about
07/01/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "I have much memories of getting more weaker"
07/01/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: please
07/01/2022, 02:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lady writes lime a Markov chain
07/01/2022, 02:18 - Merilyn Wong: I will watch this in the morning ty
07/01/2022, 02:18 - Patsy Ng: :)
07/01/2022, 03:19 - Sienna Lam: The spreadsheet not giving me access
07/01/2022, 03:24 - Patsy Ng: shared
07/01/2022, 03:34 - Cindy Yang: isolating

07/01/2022, 03:35 - Sienna Lam: Thanks
07/01/2022, 03:37 - Cindy Yang: lovely
07/01/2022, 04:04 - Damien Fung: damienfung616@gmail.com
07/01/2022, 04:17 - Sienna Lam: Who is shibe
07/01/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: V funny that this essay question is about Shakespeare's sonnets portraying his sexuality as fluid, like, just say gay!!!
07/01/2022, 04:20 - Sienna Lam: Or bi
07/01/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, just being non-heteronormative does not imply fluidity
07/01/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sure, but I meant gay as an umbrella term
07/01/2022, 04:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It would be really funny to do this entire essay exploring all the ways in which Shakespeare queers stuff and then end with "in conclusion no, there's no evidence to suggest Shakespeare's sexuality was fluid, in fact he seems pretty consistently queer"
07/01/2022, 04:22 - Sienna Lam: Maybe he had a bicycle
07/01/2022, 04:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He has a bunch of poems which are like
07/01/2022, 04:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "Damn this femboy is so cute that even I kinda wanna hit"
07/01/2022, 04:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And "Please rawdog your wife and spread your genes bc you're so sexy aha"
07/01/2022, 04:23 - Sienna Lam: Well most bi people have a fluid sexuality otherwise there wouldn’t be a bicycle
07/01/2022, 04:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also "why isn't this twink ageing, I'm so old now and yet this twink is still sexc"
07/01/2022, 04:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think a case could be made to say like
07/01/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Shakespeare saw gender and its associated roles as fluid and not discrete
07/01/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or that his sexuality was non-heteronormative
07/01/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But to say that his sexuality is fluid specifically is super odd phrasing
07/01/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also unironically goals
07/01/2022, 04:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
07/01/2022, 04:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Actually this one kinda does imply fluidity but "please get married and rawdog your wife" still doesn't
07/01/2022, 04:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence"

goddamn
07/01/2022, 04:43 - Patsy Ng: dewit
07/01/2022, 04:43 - Patsy Ng: wait have classes already started for you

08/01/2022, 05:36 - Patsy Ng: neither
08/01/2022, 05:37 - Patsy Ng: I think the most desirable things are states of being and those are kind of hard to wish for or even to describe

08/01/2022, 05:51 - Patsy Ng: so just a freak shooting star
08/01/2022, 05:52 - Patsy Ng: anyway blue means the meteor had magnesium apparently
08/01/2022, 05:53 - Patsy Ng: wait another site has a colour scale and it's closer to iron than magnesium

so it probably had a mix
08/01/2022, 10:12 - Cindy Yang: quarantids? interesting name
08/01/2022, 14:00 - Sienna Lam: Omicron is as infective as measles apparently

08/01/2022, 23:00 - Tara: I hear other humans there and I hate them
08/01/2022, 23:00 - Patsy Ng: there are loads of kids in minecraft merch being really excited around the old computers

one of them apparently dragged their dad there and does loads of programming at home and they're nine years old
08/01/2022, 23:00 - Tara: Wow such drive
08/01/2022, 23:00 - Tara: Interesting child I hope they continue
08/01/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: I'm guessing they're a couple and they're both compsci students at cambridge
08/01/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: it sounds like the guy is trying to show off what he remembers about basic to the girl but also there are manuals lying there on the table

tbf he does seem to know a lot tho
08/01/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: yeah they seem cool

08/01/2022, 23:12 - Patsy Ng: nah at cambridge visiting sibling
08/01/2022, 23:12 - Patsy Ng: hence guessing the compsci students were from cambridge

09/01/2022, 00:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh no wonder her surname was Lovelace til
09/01/2022, 00:18 - Patsy Ng: apparently they made some changes to the story regarding SQ tho
09/01/2022, 00:18 - Patsy Ng: like SQ is mr curtain's (adopted?) son
09/01/2022, 00:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was always like "why is her name different from lord Byron's?" but I assumed she just married some random guy called lovelace
09/01/2022, 00:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh I don't care very much about sq
09/01/2022, 00:19 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>

09/01/2022, 02:26 - Damien Fung: more focus on the subject, better contrast, good colour palette, good reflections
09/01/2022, 02:26 - Patsy Ng: this one
09/01/2022, 02:27 - Damien Fung: meant to say first one
09/01/2022, 02:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: Okie
09/01/2022, 02:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This one, colours most crisp
09/01/2022, 02:27 - Damien Fung: idk how i ended up typing tnoe
09/01/2022, 02:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also other ones with the bit on the right unbalance the focus
09/01/2022, 02:29 - Damien Fung: hmmm i wanna do another photoshoot but idk what else i can do to top my previous winter album
09/01/2022, 02:34 - Tanushree Banerjee: Also help

09/01/2022, 02:34 - Tanushree Banerjee: Which pic good
09/01/2022, 02:34 - Damien Fung: 2nd
09/01/2022, 02:34 - Damien Fung: first one has lens flare
09/01/2022, 02:34 - Tanushree Banerjee: But it’s prettyyyy
09/01/2022, 02:35 - Damien Fung: also it doesn't have a clear subject
09/01/2022, 02:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 3 but filter it. Too much empty space in 1&2
09/01/2022, 02:36 - Tanushree Banerjee: Okieee
09/01/2022, 02:36 - Damien Fung: i think if you re positioned in this to make the pack of trees the only thing in frame it'd be a lot stronger
09/01/2022, 02:36 - Damien Fung: by 2nd i meant this
09/01/2022, 02:36 - Damien Fung: the real 1st one just loaded for me
09/01/2022, 02:37 - Damien Fung: this one ain't bad but the camera's too low so you don't get the leading lines of the path
09/01/2022, 02:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah it's all about framing
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I had the same issue taking photos in scotland
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Damien Fung: for editing 3 specifically i'd darken it (so turn down the exposure) and desaturate the blue a bit
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Landscapes are just too flat, even when mountainous
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It 100% needs darkening yeah
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Damien Fung: o in that case you just need a subject in frame for a sense of scale
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Tanushree Banerjee: Oooo
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Tanushree Banerjee: I rlly like this tho
09/01/2022, 02:40 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lens flare can be artistic lol
09/01/2022, 02:41 - Damien Fung: having a car or person in frame helps storytelling by a lot
09/01/2022, 02:41 - Damien Fung: yeah but not in this case
09/01/2022, 02:41 - Tanushree Banerjee: I like it thooooo :(
09/01/2022, 02:41 - Tanushree Banerjee: Ok
09/01/2022, 02:41 - Damien Fung: it's good when used in very specific situations
09/01/2022, 02:42 - Damien Fung: the lighting's already too harsh here so lens flare just harshens it more
09/01/2022, 02:46 - Patsy Ng: i like this one
09/01/2022, 02:49 - Tanushree Banerjee: Okie

11/01/2022, 09:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's a running bit on my twitter how the real distinction between grown-ups and young adults, rich and poor, and so on, the distinguishing mark of financial stability... Is whether or not you're willing to spend money on a variable temperature kettle

11/01/2022, 09:24 - Cindy Yang: why would they write the teas down in the same arrangement as the actual teas in the box and then not have them correspond smh
11/01/2022, 09:26 - Cindy Yang: i put them all in the right places and it was like a puzzle
11/01/2022, 09:26 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>

11/01/2022, 09:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no bc it needs space to expand
11/01/2022, 09:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So probably the fish is more than a teaspoon in volume

12/01/2022, 06:40 - Damien Fung: man i'm learning set notation in 3 different courses
12/01/2022, 06:40 - Damien Fung: they do be wanting me to memorize these damn symbols
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Rishibh Prakash: Are they at least consistent in the different courses
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Damien Fung: mostly
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Rishibh Prakash: I swear everybody has their own way of denoting complements
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Damien Fung: but for power set one of my courses uses omega while the others use P(A)
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Damien Fung: and yeah complements
12/01/2022, 07:07 - Damien Fung: it's either A' or A^c
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Rishibh Prakash: At least you don't use 2^A
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Damien Fung: oh wait yeah 2^omega
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Damien Fung: not just omega
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Damien Fung: omega's the set itself
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Rishibh Prakash: Right right
12/01/2022, 07:08 - Rishibh Prakash: Aah I don't like that
12/01/2022, 07:09 - Damien Fung: yeah it's cursed
12/01/2022, 10:05 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
12/01/2022, 10:50 - Patsy Ng: guess who ate a california reaper pepper

because two of pearl's friends tried it and had very different reactions to the spice and I wanted to see for myself how awful the spice level was
12/01/2022, 10:51 - Damien Fung: uh oh
12/01/2022, 10:51 - Damien Fung: how'd you react
12/01/2022, 10:56 - Patsy Ng: reacted ok to the spice

did not react ok to the two pints of milk i chugged to handle the spice

asian lactose intolerance meant i threw up twice

which was good bc it means i get to avoid like. three hours of stomach pain that the friend who could not handle the spice got
12/01/2022, 10:57 - Damien Fung: o o f
12/01/2022, 10:59 - Patsy Ng: it was fun tho
12/01/2022, 11:01 - Damien Fung: i wanna get a friend a ghost pepper for his bday
12/01/2022, 11:01 - Damien Fung: we're on a quest to find the best chicken wing restaurant and we may have found it on the 4th try
12/01/2022, 11:02 - Damien Fung: but he always gets the spiciest ones bc he keeps on trying to eat the spiciest thing out there so ghost peppers should be a good gift
12/01/2022, 11:04 - Patsy Ng: wow
12/01/2022, 11:04 - Patsy Ng: can he handle the spice or is he a masochist
12/01/2022, 11:05 - Damien Fung: he can handle it
12/01/2022, 11:06 - Damien Fung: but he still tears up
12/01/2022, 11:06 - Damien Fung: he always complains that vancouver food is not spicy at all compared to like the mildest mexican food
12/01/2022, 11:07 - Damien Fung: which i agree with but compared to hk food
12/01/2022, 11:50 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
12/01/2022, 11:52 - Cindy Yang: lmaooooo i love that
12/01/2022, 11:52 - Cindy Yang: the hilarity of handling the carolina reaper just fine and then getting taken out by milk
12/01/2022, 11:54 - Cindy Yang: funky
12/01/2022, 12:14 - Cindy Yang: are y’all lactose intolerant
12/01/2022, 12:15 - Cindy Yang: idk if i am cos like statistically that is most likely but also i feel like i’ve never had a bad reaction to milk
12/01/2022, 12:15 - Cindy Yang: but maybe i just haven’t drunk enough at once
12/01/2022, 12:31 - Tara: Sometimes I feel like I am
12/01/2022, 12:31 - Tara: But probably not
12/01/2022, 12:31 - Tara: After I drink milk I feel fine
Not so much after cheese
12/01/2022, 12:39 - Cindy Yang: really? apparently cheese has less lactose
12/01/2022, 12:39 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
12/01/2022, 12:51 - Damien Fung: maybe i do but i can't tell bc i might just pass it off as normal
12/01/2022, 12:51 - Damien Fung: bc i have so much lactose stuff
12/01/2022, 12:52 - Cindy Yang: i see
12/01/2022, 12:55 - Sienna Lam: No
12/01/2022, 12:55 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
12/01/2022, 13:00 - Tara: 🤷‍♀️ I don't think I'm intolerant it might have just been that cheese

12/01/2022, 17:22 - Sienna Lam: Hot take: Thor had odinforce in infinity war and that’s how he could beat 6 stones at once
12/01/2022, 17:27 - Sienna Lam: He lost odinforve because his people who constituted the remainder of Asgard lost faith in him when he became a recluse
12/01/2022, 17:27 - Sienna Lam: And he drew power from Asgard
12/01/2022, 17:33 - Sienna Lam: Also there was a deleted scene where Odin literally gave Thor odinforce

14/01/2022, 23:37 - Cindy Yang: funky bridge
14/01/2022, 23:38 - Patsy Ng: can't remember what the exact maths stuff behind it is tho so rant if you'd like to
14/01/2022, 23:39 - Tara: The arc is made up of a bunch of tangents
14/01/2022, 23:40 - Tara: It's made up of straight planks? What's the word
14/01/2022, 23:54 - Damien Fung: 👀👀👀👀👀
14/01/2022, 23:55 - Damien Fung: the legendary bridge!!!
15/01/2022, 00:02 - Damien Fung: hehe you guys
15/01/2022, 00:03 - Damien Fung: i finally fully understand all the statistical tests we used in ib psych and exactly when/how to use them
15/01/2022, 00:03 - Damien Fung: + like 10 others
15/01/2022, 00:03 - Patsy Ng: nice
15/01/2022, 00:05 - Damien Fung: turns out we used the ones we used bc our datasets were just poo so the distributions of the tests help account for that
15/01/2022, 00:11 - Patsy Ng: funky
15/01/2022, 00:12 - Patsy Ng: also turns out it wasn't just a bug

it was a spider

and thus I did not successfully brush it off and it hitched a ride on the front of my jumper until now
15/01/2022, 00:13 - Damien Fung: new friend?
15/01/2022, 00:13 - Patsy Ng: no
15/01/2022, 00:13 - Damien Fung: new spiderman?
15/01/2022, 00:13 - Patsy Ng: its leg was crushed and tangled in my jumper fibres so it's been sent to perform in the itsy bitsy spider revival
15/01/2022, 00:15 - Damien Fung: rip
15/01/2022, 00:16 - Cindy Yang: F

15/01/2022, 06:36 - Cindy Yang: like part of me wants to be even more careful but i’m also like does it matter tho
15/01/2022, 06:36 - Cindy Yang: i mean i could catch it again but not so soon right
15/01/2022, 06:37 - Patsy Ng: idk the same? or you gear more towards not spreading it to other people???
15/01/2022, 06:37 - Cindy Yang: yea
15/01/2022, 06:37 - Cindy Yang: i’m thinking that too

15/01/2022, 07:47 - Patsy Ng: neither am I but I try to go for sth that will see regular use rather than just be pulled out for special occasions
15/01/2022, 07:48 - Damien Fung: if all else goes wrong
15/01/2022, 07:48 - Damien Fung: just get booze

15/01/2022, 10:53 - Tara: Then buy them a gift related to that
15/01/2022, 10:54 - Tara: Haha Damien's default gift is alcohol mine is a knife

15/01/2022, 12:41 - Damien Fung: awwwwwwwwwwwwww
15/01/2022, 16:05 - Tara: Sister's finally throwing away shit from 2008
15/01/2022, 16:12 - Patsy Ng: f
15/01/2022, 18:11 - Tara: Yote got my booster shot
15/01/2022, 18:11 - Tara: It was really quick we went to the place 20 minutes before we were supposed to and they just let us get vaccinated without waiting
15/01/2022, 18:13 - Merilyn Wong: Yeeee
15/01/2022, 19:03 - Tara: Streaming apps are great because I can now watch the first ten minutes of every movie we've been late to
15/01/2022, 19:04 - Tara: My strategy is to watch the first ten minutes then move on to the next movie
15/01/2022, 19:04 - Tara: Nvm this is boring
15/01/2022, 19:09 - Tara: Why did earth have two of the infinity stones
15/01/2022, 19:09 - Tara: So selfish
15/01/2022, 19:10 - Merilyn Wong: Amazing
15/01/2022, 19:18 - Sienna Lam: Thanos
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Patsy Ng: swapping trains at King's Cross and there are two teens across me in the waiting area and one of them is geeking out about maths and extolling the virtues of triangles compared to other shapes and complaining about how they weren't allowed to work on fractions in primary school
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Patsy Ng: *tweens
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Tara: Hhhh no fractions in primary school?
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Tara: Awful
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Tara: Tragic
15/01/2022, 19:50 - Tara: Illegal
15/01/2022, 19:51 - Patsy Ng: I think they just did an entrance exam for sth
15/01/2022, 19:52 - Sienna Lam: Don’t the brits have entrance exam for elite secondary schools
15/01/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: also mistyped entrance as ntrance somehow and autocorrect predicted "mtr ancestry"???
15/01/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: yeah
15/01/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: but they're like. gcse age? so it would be a sixth form school I think
15/01/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: can't remember if that's the term for schools that only do the a level years
15/01/2022, 20:07 - Patsy Ng: OK I had to swap trains at King's Cross bc there weren't any trains direct from Cambridge to Leuchars (train station closest to St Andrews)

but

the train from London to Leuchars is being rerouted due to engineering works

and it's being rerouted through... Cambridge
15/01/2022, 20:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lmao
15/01/2022, 20:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Same energy as when Cathay wanted to route me through the Netherlands to go to London when
- the Netherlands was amber
- all their flights to the Netherlands were routed through London anyway
15/01/2022, 20:11 - Patsy Ng: bruh
15/01/2022, 20:53 - Tara: They're so dramatic it's funny
15/01/2022, 20:54 - Tara: As in everyone in this
15/01/2022, 20:59 - Tara: So sad that vision died
15/01/2022, 21:04 - Merilyn Wong: 😥
15/01/2022, 21:04 - Merilyn Wong: U seen wandavision, if u havent id rewatch it w u
15/01/2022, 21:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
15/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Ha I just rewatched it
15/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Unlike Quill at least Wanda did her one job
15/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: And well too
15/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: No
15/01/2022, 21:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Crime against gimbap
15/01/2022, 21:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Evil
15/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: What's the difference between gimbap and sushi
15/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Are they the same
15/01/2022, 21:13 - Tara: Nvm googled it
15/01/2022, 21:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: gimbap is cooler
15/01/2022, 21:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And more chill imo
15/01/2022, 21:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Realistically this is gimbap and not sushi because it lacks raw fish
15/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: Coolio
15/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: Thanks
15/01/2022, 21:45 - Patsy Ng: yo what the train jsut passed a swan farm
15/01/2022, 22:01 - Merilyn Wong: :O
15/01/2022, 22:01 - Tara: A swan farm??
15/01/2022, 22:54 - Tara: How does Peggy look exactly the same as she did in the 40s
15/01/2022, 22:54 - Tara: They time travelled to the 70s right
15/01/2022, 22:55 - Merilyn Wong: supposedly during CA:TFA she's like 21 or sth cant rmb, so by now she's 50? ye she should look old as hell u right
15/01/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: esp. as a white lady
15/01/2022, 22:56 - Sienna Lam: She used anti aging drugs
15/01/2022, 22:56 - Merilyn Wong: precisely
15/01/2022, 22:56 - Merilyn Wong: was abt to say that white ladies did their hair super weird so 40 year olds look like today's 80 yearolds
15/01/2022, 22:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
15/01/2022, 22:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like, lady does not look 66
15/01/2022, 22:59 - Tara: I- she does not look like 70 or something
15/01/2022, 22:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so like canonically she looks vaguely younger than her age in 1987 so it makes sense that she still looks young in the 70s
15/01/2022, 22:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: born 1921 apparently
15/01/2022, 23:00 - Merilyn Wong: ye read some fan headcanon that she lied in her draft form
15/01/2022, 23:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's so funny how she looked hot all the way until like the 90s and then immediately became old in the 21st century
15/01/2022, 23:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: peggy carter confirmed asian
15/01/2022, 23:00 - Merilyn Wong: lmaoooooo
15/01/2022, 23:01 - Merilyn Wong: damn they shoulda gotten hayley atwell for ghost in the shell i guess
15/01/2022, 23:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: young->young->milf->dobby
15/01/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Hahahaha
15/01/2022, 23:02 - Tara: The worst part of endgame was Hawk-eye's mohawk
15/01/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Not a fan
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Sienna Lam: Or when Nat died instead of bow man
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Tara: They should be banned
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Merilyn Wong: lmao
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Tara: Nah that was fine 
His hair though? No
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Merilyn Wong: mohawkeyee
15/01/2022, 23:03 - Merilyn Wong: but everyone thinks he's called mohawk guy
15/01/2022, 23:04 - Tara: Terrible
15/01/2022, 23:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: agree
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh I'm annoyed simu liu and hailee steinfeld are getting so much hype for being asian marvel superheroes
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: as if they didn't literally have chinese popstar chloe wang in a lead role on AOS
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and scarjo in the movies
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: smh
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Hailee?
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Sienna Lam: Imagine remembering AOS exists
15/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: She's Asian??
15/01/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: half
15/01/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: filipina
15/01/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://youtu.be/pNUvqIsYo7k

who has her range?
15/01/2022, 23:09 - Tara: Ooh interesting
15/01/2022, 23:10 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/01/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Robin in HIMYM was a teenage popstar in Canada
15/01/2022, 23:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh and kumail in eternals
15/01/2022, 23:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i forgot eternals existed
15/01/2022, 23:11 - Sienna Lam: Based
15/01/2022, 23:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: as did china after chloe zhao got cancelled on weibo
15/01/2022, 23:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: china when chloe zhao gets oscar: omg with bestie
china when chloe zhao says mean things about govt: idk who this woman is
15/01/2022, 23:12 - Sienna Lam: ‘China bad’ some Chinese says
China: thanos snap
15/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: The hell is thanos able to wield the hammer
15/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Is it cos he's an eternal
15/01/2022, 23:15 - Sienna Lam: Storm breaker isn’t enchanted
15/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Oh cool
15/01/2022, 23:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I complain a lot about Chloe Bennet not getting the credit she is owed for being an Asian Marvel superhero, and like... I care a lot because I love AOS but also I care a lot because the conversation about representation in Marvel movies is kinda boring and stupid and it's funnier if they have to give credit to flop mandopop star Chloe Wang
15/01/2022, 23:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, it's funny to Actually That's Not The Truth Ellen stuff like Shang Chi
15/01/2022, 23:17 - Sienna Lam: AOS isn’t canon
15/01/2022, 23:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it was produced by marvel and therefore she predates simu liu as an asian marvel superhero
15/01/2022, 23:17 - Sienna Lam: Yea but it’s not MCU, it’s an alternate franchise. Sorta how like venom isn’t canon
15/01/2022, 23:18 - Sienna Lam: Like saying that the first gay superhero in marvel is magneto
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i mean, there's a difference in that magneto the character is not necessarily gay
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Huh it isn't? He showed up in the spider Man movie
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Yassss my favs are alive
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Sienna Lam: Ye he is, otherwise why is he played by the based gay Ian mckellan
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: true
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: I mean besides Natalie
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Natasha**
15/01/2022, 23:19 - Sienna Lam: Because he teleported from the other universe
15/01/2022, 23:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also, canon according to who? The discourse about what is and isn't canon is silly because it's so focused on successfully watching Infinity War. I want to watch AOS, I don't care about infinity war lol
15/01/2022, 23:20 - Sienna Lam: Worst take ever
15/01/2022, 23:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the real question is which movies are canon to AOS
15/01/2022, 23:20 - Tara: I love super dramatic fight battle scenes they're so fun
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Sienna Lam: They lost me when they resurrected coils on
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Sienna Lam: Could one
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Sienna Lam: Coulson
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ... episode one?
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Sienna Lam: Yep
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: consider: coulson based
15/01/2022, 23:21 - Sienna Lam: That’s like resurrecting Loki, which was a big mistake
15/01/2022, 23:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's good to be flexible about canon. for example, the twelfth doctor era is canon to the thirteenth doctor era but not vice versa imo
15/01/2022, 23:22 - Sienna Lam: If they resurrect a guy it cheapens his sacrifice. Like dragon ball or kingsman 2
15/01/2022, 23:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: you say sacrifice like he did it on purpose, he just got murdered lol
15/01/2022, 23:22 - Sienna Lam: Thirteenth doctor is the only canon anyway
15/01/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: twelfth doctor is superior but 13 is fine as her own thing
15/01/2022, 23:23 - Sienna Lam: He sacrificed himself to shoot the gun at loki
15/01/2022, 23:23 - Sienna Lam: Only women are canon cuz men don’t exist
15/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: epic
15/01/2022, 23:23 - Sienna Lam: I thanos snapped all men and now they’re all gay and Demi boys
15/01/2022, 23:24 - Sienna Lam: unironcially though if u look at ‘bromance’ it’s literally just homoromantic but you say no homo
15/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Damn Wanda fuck him up
15/01/2022, 23:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe the difference between romance and friendship is just more porous than people would prefer to admit?
15/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Avenge Vision
15/01/2022, 23:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: there is zero romantic element to my friendship with you guys but there could be to a friendship with somebody else, it's all vibes based
15/01/2022, 23:26 - Sienna Lam: Ye I agree
15/01/2022, 23:26 - Sienna Lam: Male friendships are more loving than male-female relationships roflmao
15/01/2022, 23:26 - Cindy Yang: damn we not hot enough for you? 😔 /s
15/01/2022, 23:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah sorry you should simply be hotter
15/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Peter is a great example as to why you should be polite
All the badass ladies help you
15/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Yas Queen
15/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: S
15/01/2022, 23:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i genuinely think there's no distinction between a romantic relationship and a sufficiently intimate friendship other than heteronormativity
15/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Queens
15/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Kill the bitches
15/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Stab stab
15/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: Captain marvel 💯💯💯
15/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: The tweets were right carol and Thor should've killed thanos imagine that
15/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: Screw the others
15/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: All you need is a God and someone who's absorbed an energy core
15/01/2022, 23:32 - Sienna Lam: Imagine if The end of infinity war was scarlet witch and Thor vs thanos

16/01/2022, 05:51 - Cindy Yang: i see
16/01/2022, 07:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which
16/01/2022, 07:38 - Patsy Ng: radial and galaxy chess were documented

animal chess was extremely broken but I forget how
16/01/2022, 08:19 - Cindy Yang: oof
16/01/2022, 10:58 - Tara: Bruh apparently my aunt met these two actors when she was five and her mom wanted an autograph but didn't have any paper besides her birth certificate so they signed the birth certificate
16/01/2022, 11:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: now they're your grandparents
16/01/2022, 11:00 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo iconic

16/01/2022, 14:54 - Damien Fung: man java really sucks
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Damien Fung: doing hackathon and trying to figure out a way to turn a bunch of images into a gif and it's almost impossible
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Damien Fung: we have 12.5 hours remaining to submit the group project
16/01/2022, 16:30 - Damien Fung: ok we abandoned ship on java
16/01/2022, 16:30 - Damien Fung: i found a package on R to do it for me but in not the best way
16/01/2022, 16:30 - Damien Fung: https://github.com/YellowPrawn/Spiral-Data-Visualizer/blob/main/data/Ontario.gif
16/01/2022, 16:30 - Damien Fung: take a look if y'all wanna see a funky animation
16/01/2022, 16:31 - Tara: very funky
16/01/2022, 16:31 - Tara: what does it represent
16/01/2022, 16:32 - Damien Fung: Ontario covid data
16/01/2022, 16:44 - Patsy Ng: oh damn that's cool
16/01/2022, 16:44 - Patsy Ng: 2022 is bleeding into 2021 tho
16/01/2022, 16:44 - Patsy Ng: but the spiral! the elegance!
16/01/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: and that shows how concerning the data's become
16/01/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: bc if you dive into the repo and look at other provinces they barely even go half way to the other year
16/01/2022, 16:52 - Patsy Ng: ik but since you're in charge of the scale couldn't you space it out a bit more
16/01/2022, 16:52 - Damien Fung: i would but if i change the scale you can't see like 90% of the data pre-omicron
16/01/2022, 16:53 - Patsy Ng: yikes
16/01/2022, 16:53 - Damien Fung: if i space it out then we run out of screen real-estate
16/01/2022, 19:09 - Tara: My parents are watching Emily in Paris
16/01/2022, 19:10 - Damien Fung: based
16/01/2022, 19:10 - Damien Fung: holy shit y'all this hackathon is stressful
16/01/2022, 19:10 - Tara: Is your funky animation part of the hackathon
16/01/2022, 19:11 - Damien Fung: it's 3:10 am and we've had to make a lot of compromises just so we can make enough progress to deploy a prototype
16/01/2022, 19:11 - Damien Fung: yessir
16/01/2022, 19:12 - Tara: Oh my
16/01/2022, 19:12 - Tara: You all okay?
16/01/2022, 19:12 - Damien Fung: my redbull's wearing off
16/01/2022, 19:12 - Damien Fung: so i'm gonna crash like any minute now
16/01/2022, 19:12 - Damien Fung: we've been on sprint for 16 hours
16/01/2022, 19:13 - Damien Fung: i'm the only person with any programming outside of courses so i'm mentoring all of them through this
16/01/2022, 19:15 - Tara: Oof sounds stressful
16/01/2022, 19:15 - Damien Fung: it ain't too bad
16/01/2022, 19:15 - Damien Fung: it's just that it's really hard when the only other backend dev on the team's only experienced with java
16/01/2022, 19:16 - Damien Fung: so integration was literally impossible
16/01/2022, 19:16 - Damien Fung: so we ditched java and just used the R package but kept the java code for a future release
16/01/2022, 22:29 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
16/01/2022, 22:30 - Cindy Yang: big oof
16/01/2022, 22:30 - Cindy Yang: funky
17/01/2022, 02:49 - Cindy Yang: bf brought me fruit punch that his mom made and i was expecting a juice drink but apparently guatemalan fruit punch is basically like. fruit soup

17/01/2022, 04:36 - Cindy Yang: o yea y’all i was in a breakout room with a guy who had like. a mix of a southern american accent and a british accent
17/01/2022, 04:37 - Cindy Yang: like it varied between words it was so odd
17/01/2022, 04:38 - Damien Fung: bruh
17/01/2022, 04:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: isn't that kind of us tho
17/01/2022, 04:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: not southern obv
17/01/2022, 04:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: pearl especially tbh
17/01/2022, 05:05 - Cindy Yang: perhaps
17/01/2022, 05:06 - Cindy Yang: but his was like. some words sounded very southern and then others very british
17/01/2022, 05:06 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
17/01/2022, 05:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lol i spent so long brewing this tea the Correct Way as was stated on the website and it was always overbrewed and kinda bad

now I have started doing it differently and it tastes like tang yuan soup 10/10
17/01/2022, 05:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was always like "why isn't this sweet it's supposed to be sweet" and now it's sweet
17/01/2022, 05:07 - Cindy Yang: nice
17/01/2022, 05:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sis moment
17/01/2022, 05:08 - Damien Fung: sigma male
17/01/2022, 05:08 - Damien Fung: grindset
17/01/2022, 05:09 - Patsy Ng: oh my gosh that's amazing
17/01/2022, 05:09 - Patsy Ng: what are the bits you can't click
17/01/2022, 05:10 - Damien Fung: just glitches in the svg encoding
17/01/2022, 05:10 - Patsy Ng: ?
17/01/2022, 05:10 - Patsy Ng: so they're supposed to be clickable and coloured?
17/01/2022, 05:11 - Damien Fung: the map directly allowed us to turn regions into buttons without doing anything
17/01/2022, 05:11 - Damien Fung: we just needed to detect borders
17/01/2022, 05:12 - Damien Fung: but the problem with the disconnected ones is that they're part of provinces but there's just too many of them for us to properly link them together to be clickable
17/01/2022, 05:12 - Damien Fung: ye
17/01/2022, 09:05 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
17/01/2022, 09:11 - Patsy Ng: you spent an hour last night watching worms,
in the orange glow of the lamp-light.

the path contained only four worms.
the rest were crushed
beneath a clumsy distracted ape's heel
as they dashed inside to avoid the day's downpour
                                                                       deluge
                                                                             drencher.

maybe they were too soft for this world
and now they will never get to become dirt again,
or find rebirth in a seagull's gullet
so they remain motionless,
removed from the earth.

between the outlines of their ghosts,
their brethren squirm. 
did you know that worms lack eyes?
they can only find each other through touch.
one could come so close to another and never know.

these worms do not touch;
they cannot gaze at each other.
but they are all moving in the same direction - east,
towards the grass,
towards the rising sun.

you spent an hour last night watching worms,
hoping some would see tomorrow's light.
17/01/2022, 09:13 - Patsy Ng: maybe i just need sleep but i just spent a solid minute staring at this photo trying to figure out how there was a giant ghost fish with spiky teeth and glowing eyes in the sky
17/01/2022, 09:13 - Damien Fung: bruh
17/01/2022, 09:35 - Cindy Yang: damn
17/01/2022, 09:35 - Cindy Yang: did u write that
17/01/2022, 09:35 - Cindy Yang: sp👀ky
17/01/2022, 09:37 - Patsy Ng: yeah

the concept of worms has been rattling about in my head since like. october but didn't get round to actually sitting down and doing anything about it till like. three hours ago
17/01/2022, 10:27 - Cindy Yang: damn
17/01/2022, 10:27 - Cindy Yang: very nice
17/01/2022, 10:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I like that you used the word squirm
17/01/2022, 10:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: To describe the behaviour of worms
17/01/2022, 10:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think they might be etymologically linked actually
17/01/2022, 10:30 - Cindy Yang: o funky i had to explain what squirm meant to a student of mine a while ago and i used worms
17/01/2022, 10:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: since we are sharing poetry tonight


*ode to tea, left brewing for an indeterminate amount of time in an opaque vessel*
You sit, fickle as the winter weather,
Yet summer heat hides in your china walls.
My teapot tempest, humid in thine strain:
What now, to play the cloud?
Or pour like rain.
17/01/2022, 10:30 - Cindy Yang: noicey

19/01/2022, 01:21 - Damien Fung: i think they replaced it with apple music bc no one really needed a basic music player anymore
19/01/2022, 01:21 - Tara: it's quite funny

so i did
19/01/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: based
19/01/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: it's not a very complicated game because i couldn't find a way to do genuine multithreading, so far i've only found people talking about how to allow multiprocessing
19/01/2022, 02:17 - Damien Fung: i mean R has functions so you can write anything
19/01/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: so it's just the find the invisible cow game

19/01/2022, 02:19 - Patsy Ng: to publish it??
19/01/2022, 02:19 - Damien Fung: also R files are inherently just scripts so you can just directly run them through other scripts or by running it through terminal
19/01/2022, 02:20 - Damien Fung: to file share!!!!!!!!
19/01/2022, 02:20 - Patsy Ng: kewl

19/01/2022, 03:19 - Patsy Ng: I found this site that has like. series of articles on making games in r

they have a text based adventure, a dungeon crawler, tic tac toe in a proper gui, and a broken game of pong (as far as I can see you can't actually control the user paddle, it just moves randomly)
19/01/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: also i am back from dinner

19/01/2022, 03:29 - Patsy Ng: hmm giving this a go and computer is complaining that Rscript is not a recognized thing
19/01/2022, 03:30 - Damien Fung: might be just a mac/linux thing
19/01/2022, 03:30 - Damien Fung: windows is weird for terminal commands
19/01/2022, 03:30 - Patsy Ng: probably
19/01/2022, 03:30 - Damien Fung: i've migrated my workflow to mac so idk how windows scripting works
19/01/2022, 03:31 - Patsy Ng: there should be a windows equivalent but it'll be super painful and be at least ten times as long as the mac/Linux one

19/01/2022, 06:23 - Damien Fung: the ginger negates it

19/01/2022, 08:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: (Dutch)
19/01/2022, 08:53 - Patsy Ng: what is your strategy
19/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: do you know that many five-letter words in those languages
19/01/2022, 08:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's just Mastermind but for words
19/01/2022, 08:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No but I guess what's phonotactically realistic
19/01/2022, 08:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's easiest for Spanish because there's a rhythm to it
19/01/2022, 08:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And it's hardest for English and Dutch bc dutch phonology can be like CCCVCCCC
19/01/2022, 08:55 - Cindy Yang: is there a chinese one /s
19/01/2022, 08:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I find myself a text in the language, pick a good starting word, then start bruteforcing
19/01/2022, 08:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's actually sometimes easier if you don't speak the language because you're not biased by what's common and rare, you just have to guess which words are viable
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Cindy Yang: das ist muy interesante
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Damien Fung: unrelated
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Damien Fung: but isabel is taking an introductory cs course bc of requirements in the faculty
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Damien Fung: and they don't really code in the course
19/01/2022, 08:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Cindy Yang: orgie
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Damien Fung: so they use the best "language" possible
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ooooooooooooooooof
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Damien Fung: scratch
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sekse
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Merilyn Wong: Omg yay
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Cindy Yang: oooooof
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Merilyn Wong: Probably ye for like 成語
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Cindy Yang: o yea lol my bf changed his major to cs
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh that would be fun actually
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but also difficult
19/01/2022, 08:57 - Damien Fung: 👀👀👀
19/01/2022, 08:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe it could be done with stroke order
19/01/2022, 08:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like
19/01/2022, 08:58 - Merilyn Wong: Could 11a be regime
19/01/2022, 08:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It could tell you if the word was more or less strokes, whether you got any cangjie radicals right etc
19/01/2022, 08:59 - Merilyn Wong: Nah it wouldnt be so nice, just straight tell u if thats one of the words or not
19/01/2022, 08:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: there are probs like hundreds of chengyu tho
19/01/2022, 08:59 - Merilyn Wong: My chinese tutor has a 成語 crossword she tried to let me do but i only knew 對牛彈琴
19/01/2022, 08:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah I like the stroke order idea it could be like
19/01/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Obvs four characters
19/01/2022, 09:00 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
19/01/2022, 09:00 - Merilyn Wong: Tbf like if ur a native speaker u prolly know enough to play that game
19/01/2022, 09:01 - Cindy Yang: lmao right as i asked if there was a chinese one i knew y'all were gonna come up with ideas for it
19/01/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: idk it fits letter-wise but does it fit semantically
19/01/2022, 09:01 - Merilyn Wong: Like an exercise regime
19/01/2022, 09:01 - Merilyn Wong: Idk
19/01/2022, 09:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: let's say sth like
人山人海
bc i can't be bothered to count
and you type in
画蛇添足
and it's like
+++-
and you're like okay let me try characters with less
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: wAIT there are chinese crosswords?? this changes the game
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Merilyn Wong: Ye theyre on wechat somewhere
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Merilyn Wong: Theres no clues tho
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: w
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Cindy Yang: :0
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: but how do you begin filling it in then
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Merilyn Wong: Its more like a crossword/sudoku with some characters alr in
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: ah makes sense
19/01/2022, 09:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: you'd just need a list of chengyu!!!
19/01/2022, 09:03 - Patsy Ng: wish i was good enough at chinese to do the chengyu crossword
19/01/2022, 09:03 - Cindy Yang: o i see
19/01/2022, 09:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: guys let's make the chengyu wordle
19/01/2022, 09:04 - Patsy Ng: i think stroke number would be super difficult tho
19/01/2022, 09:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe it could give you more info like
19/01/2022, 09:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Whether the character is the same in simp vs trad or not
19/01/2022, 09:04 - Cindy Yang: simp
19/01/2022, 09:04 - Patsy Ng: bc with letters the number of possible things each unknown letter could be is relatively small

but with strokes it's like. 1 to however many biang has
19/01/2022, 09:05 - Patsy Ng: hmm what about homophones as well
19/01/2022, 09:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hmmmmmmmmm
19/01/2022, 09:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: wait a sec I need bathroom so I can think
19/01/2022, 09:06 - Merilyn Wong: Maybe we shd do one tgt and like take turns hosting so someone can dole out hints and answers
19/01/2022, 09:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What are we naming it btw
19/01/2022, 09:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6hdMcMszDDbLEUVZuBlLtg1CVdVQ2YcIz5ImCSVx4k/edit?usp=sharing

19/01/2022, 09:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://github.com/octokatherine/word-master

here's a working implementation of Wordle in js that we could maybe consider adapting?
19/01/2022, 09:21 - Merilyn Wong: I saw one in some ladies office that said 越食越瘦
19/01/2022, 09:21 - Patsy Ng: there s one about apples and safety and youth/age that I can't remember but it's on my living room door at home bc my parents never bothered to take it down
19/01/2022, 09:21 - Merilyn Wong: Lmaoo
19/01/2022, 09:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: actually it's too late tonight to code so let's just work out how the game works
19/01/2022, 09:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so, what distinguishing characteristics do chinese characters have

- stroke count
- pinyin sounds?
19/01/2022, 09:22 - Merilyn Wong: 新年快樂
恭喜發財
身體健康
龍馬精神
年年有餘
Thats the ones i know
19/01/2022, 09:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think it's more elegant if we do zhuyin but nobody but me here can read them I think
19/01/2022, 09:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and doing simplified chinese + zhuyin would be messy
19/01/2022, 09:23 - Merilyn Wong: O whats zhuyin
19/01/2022, 09:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: taiwanese phonetic alphabet for chinese
19/01/2022, 09:23 - Merilyn Wong: Cool
19/01/2022, 09:26 - Patsy Ng: hhhh do the chinese telegraph code
19/01/2022, 09:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh wait no I'm stupid there's an easy solution
19/01/2022, 09:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Illustrate sound using homophones
19/01/2022, 09:27 - Patsy Ng: ?
19/01/2022, 09:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was thinking like
19/01/2022, 09:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No I'm stupid, small brain moment
19/01/2022, 09:29 - Patsy Ng: ok good night

21/01/2022, 01:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ^ coursework for patsy to look at
21/01/2022, 01:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lol i ran out of battery 1 second
21/01/2022, 01:07 - Cindy Yang: rip
21/01/2022, 01:55 - Damien Fung: ahhh
21/01/2022, 01:55 - Damien Fung: merging a pull request and seeing that purple is so satisfying
21/01/2022, 01:56 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
21/01/2022, 05:27 - Patsy Ng: wait am i misremembering the dimensions of the board or was there one more concentric circle

bc rn the first move ever can be to make a pawnstop
21/01/2022, 05:27 - Patsy Ng: like you can get out of it if the other player attacks using a pawn, then uses the freed-up knight to eat the pawnstop pawn
21/01/2022, 05:27 - Patsy Ng: but that's a bit convoluted
21/01/2022, 05:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It doesn't really matter _too_ much? It varies depending on how much space we usually have
21/01/2022, 05:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: We can just ban double movement from pawns
21/01/2022, 05:31 - Patsy Ng: hmm true
21/01/2022, 05:31 - Patsy Ng: i kinda wanna run experiments on that
21/01/2022, 05:32 - Patsy Ng: they won't be scientifically rigorous tho
21/01/2022, 05:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: honestly I have suspicions that there isn't much variance in how games go anyway
21/01/2022, 05:32 - Patsy Ng: but just. play it though to see if they'd differ
21/01/2022, 06:37 - Damien Fung: woah
21/01/2022, 06:37 - Damien Fung: a bald eagle just flew right by
21/01/2022, 06:37 - Damien Fung: i feel so american
21/01/2022, 06:41 - Cindy Yang: damnn
21/01/2022, 07:01 - Patsy Ng: ooo cooool
21/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: ok reading the shakespeare essay

- is sonnet 18's subject male-pronouned? the only male pronoun i see is in "and often is his fold complexion dimm'd", and i thought that was just a personification of the previous line's sun/"eye of heaven"

- if sonnet 126 has been prematurely ended, so it only has 12 lines, what makes it a sonnet? wouldn't it be something else?

- i really like your point about sonnet 63, and it's also just a nice sonnet in general

- power of literature strikes again

- were these sonnets published within shakespeare's lifetime, and with his own name? like how did his contemporaries not read them and go "oh that man is Not Straight"

- could some of the queerness not actually be queerness but like. you know how sometimes writers adopt a persona when writing a piece? so could he just have been writing from a woman's perspective? (ik there's no textual evidence but maybe heteronormativity just meant most people back then just made that assumption)

- also this made me revise roman numerals so much
21/01/2022, 08:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sonnet 126 has two lines that are explicitly left empty
21/01/2022, 08:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: As in on the thingy they;re

(    )
(     )
21/01/2022, 08:57 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
21/01/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They are clearly not from a lady's perspective because Shakespeare talks multiple times about how hot this one guy is but how he can't have him because he was prick'd out by nature's hand for the use of women
21/01/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: isn't that one specific sonnet
21/01/2022, 08:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: re: sonnet 18, are the summer and sun not interchangeable
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think given the number of explicitly homoerotic poems + the repetition of themes and interconnected nature of the poems implies a consistent subject and object but ymmv
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: up for debate

but the subject still isn't the summer or the sun, they're just being compared to the summer & sun
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: fair
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: were they all published together
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yes
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: with a dedication to some dude too lol
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: funky
21/01/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The homoerotic ones are all in one big chunk and then there's some other stuff at the end
21/01/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: yeah ok that makes it more queer
21/01/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: why not mention the dedication?
21/01/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: surely the context + work as a whole was relevant to the essay topic
21/01/2022, 09:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Can't really read _too_ much into "for mr. WH" but maybe I should have used that as evidence that the poems are mostly about one guy
21/01/2022, 09:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But I think it also doesn't necessarily matter if the poems are all for one guy or not, as long as it's clear that mostly he is writing about guys
21/01/2022, 09:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the sun is what makes the summer lovely and temperate, I could have written "the sun is male pronouned" instead of "the summer is male pronouned" but I sometimes make mistakes or logical leaps
21/01/2022, 09:04 - Patsy Ng: idk i kind of did that with a passage to india last year

essay topic was about friendship and the dedication was to this one dude and "our friendship of twelve years" so i wrote the conclusion around that

it got like. 18/20 so i guess it worked
21/01/2022, 09:04 - Patsy Ng: to this
21/01/2022, 09:04 - Patsy Ng: yeah fair
21/01/2022, 09:05 - Patsy Ng: wait ok i think i've misinterpreted what you wrote then

i thought
subject = unnamed person that shakespeare is writing about, who is tentatively a man
21/01/2022, 09:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: what does "power of literature strikes again" mean
21/01/2022, 09:05 - Patsy Ng: instead of subject = summer/sun
21/01/2022, 09:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yes
21/01/2022, 09:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would have used "male object" a lot more but I don't want to be seen as implying that men are objects
21/01/2022, 09:06 - Patsy Ng: just whenever we had to study set of texts for some exams, there was always at least one text that had the theme of "power of literature"

most memorably, balzac
21/01/2022, 09:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Would that not then be applicable to every piece of coursework I ever produce?
21/01/2022, 09:07 - Patsy Ng: the power of literature thing?
21/01/2022, 09:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: thinking about today's milk oolong and how much it tastes like milk all of a sudden, there's a lingering milk aftertaste even now
21/01/2022, 09:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah
21/01/2022, 09:07 - Patsy Ng: i guess???
21/01/2022, 09:08 - Patsy Ng: but i think the fun of that theme is the inceptionness of it all

like when fictional literature is about the power of fictional literature
21/01/2022, 09:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: One thing I like about the essay is that I think the stuff with nature as a lady was clever sleight of hand, linking a bunch of disparate poems to sketch out this idea of a universal woman shakespeare is angry at
21/01/2022, 09:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh right the thing about eternal lines
21/01/2022, 09:09 - Patsy Ng: so when you make it academic literature about the power of fictional literature it's less fun
21/01/2022, 09:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, I don't think anybody else would have thought to incorporate the Mistress poem on account of it not being in the prepackaged list we were given (I asked if I could use other poems) but it really characterises Nature in a way
21/01/2022, 09:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which is good because Nature is a big deal in the poems we _were_ given
21/01/2022, 09:10 - Patsy Ng: did you read all of the poems in the collection?
21/01/2022, 09:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I also don't think anybody else would have thought to link the Mistress poem to Nature to begin with because like, people are so focused on the human lady who is there that they forget about the perfect lady who actually is explicitly not
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no but the mistress one is like, ridic famous
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's even in that one catherine tate comedy sketch with the doctor who cameo
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://youtu.be/WxB1gB6K-2A
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Patsy Ng: wait is that the comic relief one where catherine tate is a student and david tennant is her scottish english teacher
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah
21/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: she recites it
21/01/2022, 09:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I actually think the sonnet 63 stuff is the least interesting bit of analysis bc it's just basically the standard interpretation, no clever tricks in play
21/01/2022, 09:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I did my one interesting thing and then ran out of original ideas (I assume, I didn't actually have time to read anybody else's interpretations but it seems really obvious to me)
21/01/2022, 09:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think it would have made a really good essay of half the length but I had to pad for time by saying obvious things
21/01/2022, 09:15 - Patsy Ng: it's obvious but like. immortalizing someone else is Good Shit i fall for it every time
21/01/2022, 09:16 - Patsy Ng: also do you have a properly formatted version of sonnet 126 bc i can't really figure out where the missing lines are supposed to go
21/01/2022, 09:16 - Patsy Ng: like
21/01/2022, 09:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: At the end?
21/01/2022, 09:17 - Patsy Ng: the last two lines of the sonnet on the gutenberg version rhyme

meaning that it's the end of the sonnet, bc it's the rhyming couplet

which means that if the lines are missing, then they've been like. removed from the middle of the poem

which means the poem wasn't truncated, it was more. bisected.

giving it a different connotation
21/01/2022, 09:18 - Patsy Ng: oh wait
21/01/2022, 09:18 - Patsy Ng: it's aabbccddeeff format
21/01/2022, 09:18 - Patsy Ng: nvm
21/01/2022, 09:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
21/01/2022, 09:19 - Patsy Ng: yeah ok the analysis makes a lot more sense now
21/01/2022, 09:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: any other vague thoughts?
21/01/2022, 09:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's long since submitted but I've never had anybody else look over it
21/01/2022, 09:28 - Patsy Ng: just minor wonderings about some of your capitalization choices
21/01/2022, 09:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah I might lose points for Nature or Perfection or whatever else but I feel like they're legitimate choices
21/01/2022, 09:29 - Patsy Ng: like "western literary canon" instead of "Western literary canon"
21/01/2022, 09:30 - Patsy Ng: i think capitalizing Nature and Sun and stuff is ok tho

bc shakespeare's already personified them
21/01/2022, 09:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: that's not intentional but given the choice I would still probably not have capitalised western because lol
21/01/2022, 09:31 - Patsy Ng: hmm you know the bit about sonnet 9 being an argument
21/01/2022, 09:31 - Patsy Ng: was shakespeare around for the rationalist poetry movement
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think probably not?
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Patsy Ng: wacko
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Patsy Ng: do you think it could have been a precursor then
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't know
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Patsy Ng: bc it does kind of fit the form of a rationalist poem
21/01/2022, 09:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: can you give an example
21/01/2022, 09:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: of a rationalist poem
21/01/2022, 09:33 - Patsy Ng: to his coy mistress
21/01/2022, 09:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ayyyyyyyyyyyyy
21/01/2022, 09:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I feel like you could probably make a good argument that 9 and To His Coy Mistress are similar in many ways
21/01/2022, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tyvm late moffat
21/01/2022, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The episode with two Masters where Twelve is trying to get Missy to see his point of view is named "world enough and time" because it's about him asking his coy mistress to be with him in a way
21/01/2022, 09:35 - Patsy Ng: ohhhhhh
21/01/2022, 09:35 - Patsy Ng: i always thought it was just about twelve wanting more time to be twelve and not having to change
21/01/2022, 09:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: he doesn't even die until The Doctor Falls tho
21/01/2022, 09:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's also about how there's an entire world in the bottom of the colony ship in a way, and there is time dilation
21/01/2022, 09:36 - Patsy Ng: yeah but it's a two parter

he probably has an intuition that he's gonna die
21/01/2022, 09:37 - Patsy Ng: don't think i mentioned but i had a phase a couple months ago where i was trying to memorize it
21/01/2022, 09:37 - Patsy Ng: didn't get any furhter than the first four lines tho
21/01/2022, 09:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: isn't it about fucking
21/01/2022, 09:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's not like The Flea or anything but it's 100% about fucking
21/01/2022, 09:38 - Patsy Ng: anyway what's fun about it is it's written in the same meter that the passionate shepherd to his love is, so you can sing it along with stacey kent's performance of come live with me from the 1997 richard iii movie
21/01/2022, 09:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hhhhhhhhhh
21/01/2022, 09:39 - Patsy Ng: it just sounds nice

if you focus on the bit about wanting infinite time to build your dreams then it's kind of a great escapism soundtrack
21/01/2022, 09:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "to build your dreams" uh
21/01/2022, 09:39 - Patsy Ng: not soundtrack soundtrack but like. think to idly recite in your mind as you do other things
21/01/2022, 09:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i think it's specifically not about having time to wait?
21/01/2022, 09:40 - Patsy Ng: yeah
21/01/2022, 09:40 - Patsy Ng: but just. the vibe
21/01/2022, 09:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "yeah it would be nice if we had all this time, we could do all this cool stuff, but we don't so let's bang" iconic
21/01/2022, 09:41 - Patsy Ng: there's a like. 1980's rock song that was never released and the demo version was leaked and it was based off the poem and it changes the time's winged chariot line to "but time's winged chariot is ever at our back/and its long skanky finger goes smack smack smack"
21/01/2022, 09:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's like reading LBDSM for the descriptions of pretty girls
21/01/2022, 09:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: or porphyria's lover for the brief bits about love
21/01/2022, 09:42 - Patsy Ng: and there's just something so awfully Fun about the juxtaposition of beautiful elizabethan english with modern brit slang
21/01/2022, 09:43 - Patsy Ng: nah i read porphyria's lover for the murder descriptions
21/01/2022, 09:46 - Patsy Ng: ok going back to this 

i think it's bc i never got round to memorizing the bit where the urgency is revealed

so all i can loop round in my brain is 
"if we had world enough and time / this coyness, mistress, would be no crime / we could sit down and think which way / to walk, and pass our long love's day" and "a hundred years should go to praise / thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze / two hundred to adore each breast / but thirty thousand to the rest / an age at least to every part / and the last age should show your heart"
21/01/2022, 09:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Hhhhh
21/01/2022, 09:49 - Patsy Ng: found it

21/01/2022, 13:08 - Damien Fung: basically it's a test that can only be effectively used in modern statistics since the old statisticians didn't have computers strong enough to perform it
21/01/2022, 13:09 - Damien Fung: you're basically throwing your data in and you try every possible permutation of the stuff until you get your results
21/01/2022, 13:09 - Damien Fung: gets rid of many biases bc of the randomization process

21/01/2022, 22:33 - Cindy Yang: like idk i kinda assume students are all spending their money regardless of countrz wat do i say
21/01/2022, 22:34 - Cindy Yang: german students be spending their money on doner and pretzel american students be spending their money on cheesed borger
21/01/2022, 22:39 - Tara: yes exactly
21/01/2022, 22:49 - Merilyn Wong: German people buy exclusively Schnitzel and Lederhosen
21/01/2022, 22:59 - Patsy Ng: write the essay about a a hypothetical german student you're fake pen pals with and start their purchases off normal but as the essay progresses make them have an obsession with buying a really niche type of thing that is unsettling but not outright creepy
21/01/2022, 23:12 - Merilyn Wong: He buys lots of dog accessories

22/01/2022, 01:03 - Patsy Ng: like. it's written in c so it's plausible that the code has remained unchanged since 2003
22/01/2022, 01:04 - Tara: definitely 2003
22/01/2022, 01:04 - Patsy Ng: but if it really is from 2003 then it's older than some of the people on my course (direct entry students skip first year)
22/01/2022, 01:04 - Tara: yikes
22/01/2022, 01:09 - Damien Fung: wait so are there no packages included?
22/01/2022, 01:10 - Damien Fung: i'd assume if you have to use any then in that you'd have a version which doesn't support 90% of the code in the file
22/01/2022, 01:11 - Cindy Yang: fuck i forgot the meaning of a word in german and i ended up saying it's not fun to have a lot of vacation
22/01/2022, 01:14 - Damien Fung: how stereotypically german /s
22/01/2022, 01:16 - Patsy Ng: it's like four lines of code to demonstrate print formats

22/01/2022, 05:50 - Damien Fung: :(
22/01/2022, 08:52 - Patsy Ng: cooking in one of the three kitchens shared by all the ~250 people in my hall is super stressful and also the cleanup is a pain so this semester i'm gonna try avoid kitchen cooking + ready-made meals / sandwiches by figuring out stuff you can actually cook in a microwave

and it turns out there is a Lot

did not know you could make mac & cheese in a microwave, or like. most rice + egg dishes
22/01/2022, 08:53 - Damien Fung: tried that
22/01/2022, 08:53 - Damien Fung: texture was wack
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: was it edible tho
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Damien Fung: barely
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Damien Fung: eggs were nasty
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: o F
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Damien Fung: noodles nasty
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: idk i tried microwave muffins over christmas break and they turned out pretty good
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Damien Fung: rice was pre al dente
22/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: so i assumed other stuff would work
22/01/2022, 08:55 - Damien Fung: yeah but muffins are just muffins
22/01/2022, 08:55 - Damien Fung: we made them in an orange over a fire
22/01/2022, 08:55 - Patsy Ng: fair
22/01/2022, 09:12 - Cindy Yang: had microwave mac n cheese during break it was aight
22/01/2022, 09:12 - Patsy Ng: hmm conflicting experiences

i see i will have to try it myself
22/01/2022, 09:13 - Damien Fung: i mean things that have labels which tell you that they're microwaveable are different but like otherwise it might be weird
22/01/2022, 09:14 - Patsy Ng: oh fair
22/01/2022, 09:14 - Patsy Ng: when i mean cooking using the microwave i am not talking about microwave meals

22/01/2022, 11:46 - Damien Fung: usually by now giveaways have like 500 comments for entry but i think bc it's about sex toys there's only 23
22/01/2022, 11:46 - Damien Fung: and i think like 15 come from this 1 person
22/01/2022, 11:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Probably because people don't want to use their real names lol

24/01/2022, 12:03 - Rishibh Prakash: This will mean nothing to anybody but I need to get this out: I just managed to show that the Grothendieck group of any abelian semigroup/monoid is unique (up to isomorphism)

You may now proceed with your day
24/01/2022, 12:04 - Cindy Yang: :) i understand
24/01/2022, 12:04 - Merilyn Wong: Excellent
24/01/2022, 12:07 - Rishibh Prakash: Tbf it sounds fancier than it actually is
24/01/2022, 12:08 - Cindy Yang: what does it mean
24/01/2022, 12:09 - Damien Fung: having dinner with 2 math honours friends and they also understand 1 of these funky words
24/01/2022, 12:14 - Rishibh Prakash: I'm guessing it was group
24/01/2022, 12:18 - Rishibh Prakash: We have the natural numbers N which are {0, 1, 2, ...}. And then you have the integers Z which is {..., -1, 0, 2, ...}. What you can say is that the integers are the smallest set where it makes sense to subtract two natural numbers (you can have larger sets like the rational numbers or the real numbers but nothing smaller).
24/01/2022, 12:18 - Rishibh Prakash: I showed that this works in general and that there is in fact only one such "smallest set"
24/01/2022, 12:19 - Rishibh Prakash: Whoops that should be {...-1, 0, 1, ...} for Z
24/01/2022, 12:26 - Cindy Yang: noice
24/01/2022, 12:27 - Tara: wdym makes sense

24/01/2022, 12:33 - Tara: they'll just eat the other fish
24/01/2022, 12:35 - Tara: so i can fish them in the sims

24/01/2022, 23:13 - Patsy Ng: telescope eye goldfish
24/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: It's still
24/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Awful**
24/01/2022, 23:14 - Patsy Ng: i googled "globe eye goldfish" and tons of telescope eye goldfish came up in addition to the globe eye goldfishes so i think they could be the same type of goldfish
24/01/2022, 23:14 - Cindy Yang: i wonder how often their eyes fall out
24/01/2022, 23:15 - Patsy Ng: what
24/01/2022, 23:15 - Patsy Ng: what do you mean how often
24/01/2022, 23:15 - Patsy Ng: ideally. 0
24/01/2022, 23:15 - Cindy Yang: true i mean i feel like it'd be easier for them to fall out than for regular fish
24/01/2022, 23:15 - Cindy Yang: also mean how often for the breed in general not like. on average for each fish
24/01/2022, 23:17 - Patsy Ng: ok i googled and nothing came up apart from this fish disease called popeye disease so i think their eyes do not fall out
24/01/2022, 23:18 - Patsy Ng: and anecdotes of people's goldfishes losing their eyes after traumatic injuries like if their fish swam into the tank wall really fast
24/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: No!
24/01/2022, 23:18 - Cindy Yang: i see
24/01/2022, 23:18 - Cindy Yang: yea that makes sense
24/01/2022, 23:56 - Patsy Ng: wait ok got distracted and googled again

and goldfish really do have noses

it's really just. nostrils but the goldfish equivalent (called nares) are only used to smell things and not to breathe

25/01/2022, 02:44 - Patsy Ng: do any of you remember that guided reading book or sth where a teenager had to do community service and the service was to be a paraplegic guy's assistant for doing all the things a blowtube-controlled machine couldn't do (and the guy's entire house was devoid of mirrors bc he hated seeing himself but that bit is irrelevant)

how would that even work

the teenager had zero training and was also a teenage delinquent who was absolutely not inclined to help people

like what if the paraplegic dude needed medical help or sth

and the two people actively hated each other
25/01/2022, 04:44 - Cindy Yang: lmaooooo someone just accidentally unmuted and said 'legit just missed my whole fucking class'

25/01/2022, 09:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If you drink a cocktail in a dress it becomes a cocktail dress
25/01/2022, 09:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or
25/01/2022, 09:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Cocktail dress is a dress that fits the role of cocktail dress, rather than any specific set of traits
25/01/2022, 09:54 - Cindy Yang: a cocktail dress is a dress made out of cock’s tails
25/01/2022, 10:01 - Damien Fung: is the tail of a cock the bellend or the balls
25/01/2022, 10:03 - Cindy Yang: 🤔🤔🤔

25/01/2022, 23:28 - Cindy Yang: nice
25/01/2022, 23:28 - Cindy Yang: o ye funky
25/01/2022, 23:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Specifically most languages have a specific way letters come together
25/01/2022, 23:29 - Cindy Yang: i usually go for words i know in german but spanish i just start inputting combinations of letters that sound spanish by the end
25/01/2022, 23:30 - Cindy Yang: mm i see
25/01/2022, 23:30 - Cindy Yang: helps that the german ones so far all seem to be pretty basic words
25/01/2022, 23:31 - Merilyn Wong: Wow didnt realize we were allowed repeats in german
25/01/2022, 23:31 - Patsy Ng: yeah cause five letters isn't enough to fit the frankenwords that german loves
25/01/2022, 23:31 - Cindy Yang: o yea
25/01/2022, 23:31 - Cindy Yang: in any wordle i think

26/01/2022, 00:30 - Patsy Ng: nop
26/01/2022, 00:53 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
26/01/2022, 01:12 - Cindy Yang: 🥺
26/01/2022, 08:06 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
26/01/2022, 08:06 - Damien Fung: me: hold my python
26/01/2022, 08:21 - Cindy Yang: nice
26/01/2022, 08:21 - Cindy Yang: bruhh i was thinking about diff languages ways of expressing hunger
26/01/2022, 08:22 - Cindy Yang: and german and spanish both have like ‘i have hunger’
26/01/2022, 08:23 - Cindy Yang: and i was thinking about chinese and at first i was like ya it’s just the same as english lol
26/01/2022, 08:24 - Cindy Yang: but like. u add 了 after 饿 so. it’s gotta be a verb
26/01/2022, 08:25 - Cindy Yang: so it means hungered rather than am hungry
26/01/2022, 08:25 - Cindy Yang: idk maybe this was obvious to other ppl
26/01/2022, 08:26 - Damien Fung: i hungered
26/01/2022, 08:26 - Cindy Yang: exactly
26/01/2022, 08:33 - Cindy Yang: oh wait u can say 我不饿tho. hmm so i guess not necessarily a verb always
26/01/2022, 08:33 - Cindy Yang: definitely in 我饿了tho
26/01/2022, 08:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: korean has "my belly is hungry"
26/01/2022, 08:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's not really clear what the difference is between korean verbs and adjectives
26/01/2022, 08:41 - Cindy Yang: o ya u can say that in chinese too
26/01/2022, 08:41 - Cindy Yang: i never do tho lol
26/01/2022, 08:41 - Cindy Yang: interesante
26/01/2022, 08:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: du zi e yeah
26/01/2022, 08:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, you can theoretically say "我不verb," but generally that means "i never do this thing"
26/01/2022, 08:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 我不喝酒，我不吃肉 and all that.

"i never hunger" would be based
26/01/2022, 08:43 - Cindy Yang: ehh yea in those contexts but depends on the verb
26/01/2022, 08:45 - Cindy Yang: actuallt i mean i feel like that’s just the same as saying ‘i don’t verb’, with the context implying the never
26/01/2022, 09:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yo Tara are you up
26/01/2022, 09:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: or like
26/01/2022, 09:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: @16092405334

26/01/2022, 09:23 - Damien Fung: ngl I don't think having stuff from 2019's gonna look very good on a cv
26/01/2022, 09:23 - Damien Fung: bc it might tell them you haven't been active since then?
26/01/2022, 09:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I have basically nothing else?
26/01/2022, 09:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which years did we end up going
26/01/2022, 09:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: On account of the sudden switch in subjects
26/01/2022, 09:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But also it's a digital marketing internship within my department at university so like, not having much pre-degree seems reasonable

27/01/2022, 00:52 - Patsy Ng: funky

27/01/2022, 00:58 - Sienna Lam: They make the year 4 enroll first
27/01/2022, 00:58 - Sienna Lam: Which is gay it should be first come first serve
27/01/2022, 00:59 - Tara: gay?
27/01/2022, 00:59 - Sienna Lam: Based
27/01/2022, 01:00 - Sienna Lam: It’s made by cis gays instead of based aces/s
27/01/2022, 01:00 - Tara: what
27/01/2022, 01:01 - Tara: ok
27/01/2022, 01:01 - Sienna Lam: Well I’m gay so I can say gay
27/01/2022, 01:03 - Sienna Lam: Lesbians are terfs anyway
27/01/2022, 01:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: not all of them
27/01/2022, 01:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lots of lesbians are nice
27/01/2022, 01:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: you ought to make more lesbian friends
27/01/2022, 01:04 - Tara: excuse me
27/01/2022, 01:04 - Tara: ^^
27/01/2022, 01:05 - Tara: remember michelle from the pride market
27/01/2022, 01:06 - Tara: is she a terf? i think not
27/01/2022, 01:06 - Tara: she was probably the nicest, most respectful person ive met
27/01/2022, 01:06 - Tara: with a great fashion sense
27/01/2022, 01:06 - Tara: i mean she had a handbag in the shape of a boot hahaha
27/01/2022, 01:25 - Sienna Lam: She was talking to me about what pride flags I got and it was really embarrassing cuz I got the trans flag so I had to deny I was trans
27/01/2022, 01:26 - Tara: because you assumed she was a terf?
27/01/2022, 01:26 - Sienna Lam: I don’t tell anyone who I only just met I’m trans
27/01/2022, 01:33 - Sienna Lam: I was annoyed because she pushed it when I just said I had the bi flag
27/01/2022, 01:46 - Cindy Yang: sis what
27/01/2022, 01:56 - Cindy Yang: o funky thing selvin texts ‘uuuh’ sometimes and i was confused at first but then i realized it’s probably spanish ‘oooh’
27/01/2022, 01:59 - Patsy Ng: uuuh
27/01/2022, 02:05 - Sienna Lam: Uuuuuu
27/01/2022, 02:38 - Damien Fung: hehe y'all i finally bought a book without being forced to

27/01/2022, 02:41 - Damien Fung: that was fast
27/01/2022, 02:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: probably not many people applied, it's an internal thing so it's only applied linguistics undergrads
27/01/2022, 02:42 - Damien Fung: i mean fair enough they have to graduate soon so giving them prio is good so they can finish their credits
27/01/2022, 02:43 - Damien Fung: ah fair
27/01/2022, 02:43 - Damien Fung: meanwhile ubc coop taking 3 months to give me a reply on whether I'm in or not
27/01/2022, 02:43 - Damien Fung: when the quota's 15 people in the stats program
27/01/2022, 02:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and I'm the only person who pays attention to the internal workings of the department, everybody else just kind of turns up at class while I go to all the weekly meetings and stuff
27/01/2022, 02:43 - Damien Fung: nice nice
27/01/2022, 02:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 02:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: part B when
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Patsy Ng: wait what really why would you do that to yourself
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Patsy Ng: like. staff meetings???
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no casual ones
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they do zoom hangouts on tuesdays for anybody involved in the fiekld
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and obviously I want to be first choice for
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: stuff like this
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Patsy Ng: ah
27/01/2022, 02:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so that means I put on my striped shirts every Tuesday evening and hang out with the department, do their quizzes and stuff
27/01/2022, 02:55 - Patsy Ng: are there other students or is it just you vibing
27/01/2022, 02:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There are other students but nobody as consistent as me
27/01/2022, 02:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The shirts are important because I'm therefore identifiable in class
27/01/2022, 02:55 - Patsy Ng: yeah i figured
27/01/2022, 02:56 - Patsy Ng: can't believe you gave yourself a uniform tho
27/01/2022, 02:57 - Patsy Ng: also how does an english exam with relatively short answer questions work
27/01/2022, 02:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's one of my Linguistics modules
27/01/2022, 02:57 - Patsy Ng: funky?
27/01/2022, 03:14 - Cindy Yang: noice
27/01/2022, 03:14 - Cindy Yang: rip

27/01/2022, 04:12 - Damien Fung: the true superhero musical
27/01/2022, 05:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 05:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: imagining this guy reading that book for the first time and having his  mind blown by huge concepts like "what if a british person... were Korean????"
27/01/2022, 05:51 - Cindy Yang: lmaoooo
27/01/2022, 08:32 - Damien Fung: massive cloud just passed over and it went from clear skies to foggy in a minute
27/01/2022, 08:39 - Cindy Yang: wack
27/01/2022, 08:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 08:50 - Damien Fung: bruh
27/01/2022, 08:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's no judgement he just looks like
27/01/2022, 08:51 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 08:53 - Patsy Ng: once someone brought this up in physics and we had to explain the meme to christ of the gill
27/01/2022, 08:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: somebody brought this meme up in physics???
27/01/2022, 08:53 - Patsy Ng: well. before class started
27/01/2022, 08:54 - Patsy Ng: they had the same thought you did and aard was right there to talk to
27/01/2022, 08:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: man
27/01/2022, 09:09 - Cindy Yang: hhh
27/01/2022, 09:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Imagine being Aard and eternally having to be compared to the beta heterosexual
27/01/2022, 10:12 - Sienna Lam: Gay men are based as hell, straight men… not so much
27/01/2022, 11:14 - Tara: Nice people are based
27/01/2022, 11:15 - Tara: Be them straight or gay
27/01/2022, 12:16 - Merilyn Wong: Based ppl based
27/01/2022, 12:38 - Cindy Yang: so true
27/01/2022, 12:43 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 13:08 - Merilyn Wong: Lmao
27/01/2022, 13:13 - Damien Fung: now duo's coming after you
27/01/2022, 13:13 - Damien Fung: if duo can't have you no one can
27/01/2022, 13:16 - Merilyn Wong: Throwback
27/01/2022, 13:16 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 13:16 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 13:16 - Merilyn Wong: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 13:18 - Cindy Yang: awww das us
27/01/2022, 17:24 - Sienna Lam: Lesbians are really restrictive on who gets to be a lesbian. Like a man once? Can’t be a lesbian. Is trans woman? Can’t be a lesbian. Yet they allow trans men to be lesbians, which is inherently transphobic
27/01/2022, 17:34 - Tara: Sis stop generalising
27/01/2022, 17:34 - Tara: Do you know any lesbians 
Are they like this
27/01/2022, 17:34 - Sienna Lam: On the internet
27/01/2022, 17:35 - Tara: So you think those internet lesbians represent an entire group of people
27/01/2022, 17:35 - Tara: Got it
27/01/2022, 17:35 - Sienna Lam: The community vs individuals
27/01/2022, 17:37 - Sienna Lam: Generally, individual lesbians will be nice. However, the community as a whole is filled with terfs
27/01/2022, 17:39 - Sienna Lam: Also, suspicious of michelle as why was she pushing to know which flags I got when it was none of her business and it could be very sensitive
27/01/2022, 17:51 - Tara: Michelle asked _once_ out of curiosity
27/01/2022, 17:51 - Tara: She asked everyone
27/01/2022, 17:51 - Tara: Did she push you after you said none of your business
27/01/2022, 17:51 - Sienna Lam: I said the bi flag and she said ‘and’ which was like a bit rude
27/01/2022, 17:53 - Tara: ""lesbians are terfs anyway""
27/01/2022, 17:54 - Sienna Lam: They don’t let me be a lesbian just because of something I was born with and don’t even want
27/01/2022, 18:00 - Tara: Who is they
27/01/2022, 18:00 - Tara: Again, the online lesbians?
27/01/2022, 18:01 - Sienna Lam: Yea
27/01/2022, 18:01 - Tara: They're not in your life though??
27/01/2022, 18:01 - Tara: Cut them off
27/01/2022, 18:01 - Tara: Why even engage with the online lesbians
27/01/2022, 18:01 - Tara: Omg I can't believe I'm just calling them the online lesbians
27/01/2022, 18:02 - Sienna Lam: Cuz the gay scene in HK is pretty small or at least quite hard to access
27/01/2022, 18:03 - Tara: And at UST? Have you met any LGBT folks
27/01/2022, 18:03 - Tara: Are you following rainbow bird
27/01/2022, 18:03 - Tara: No doubt you'll find more positive people
27/01/2022, 18:03 - Sienna Lam: Not yet but I will message them
27/01/2022, 18:03 - Tara: Who wouldn't just exclude you
27/01/2022, 18:12 - Tara: Sienna seriously if you have a problem why not just tell us instead of going about it in such a convoluted way by vilifying an entire community
27/01/2022, 18:12 - Tara: I was this close to cancelling you 🤏
27/01/2022, 18:13 - Tara: /g
27/01/2022, 18:55 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah new value of pi dropped

we were learning about defining stuff in c yesterday and my tutor did "#define PI = 4.3" as an example

I got a snip but unfortunately I lost it when I forgot I still needed to send it and snipped something else
27/01/2022, 18:59 - Tara: 4.3...
27/01/2022, 19:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think this year I will try and make my own nian gao
27/01/2022, 19:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It doesn't matter what random online lesbians think, lots of random online gay men are shitty centrist white dudes and I get by just fine ignoring them
27/01/2022, 19:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, yes, there is a genre of weird brain worm associated specifically with certain online lesbian communities, but despite what they might claim, they're not The Entire Lesbian Community
27/01/2022, 19:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 19:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 21:03 - Sienna Lam: Ban South Park please
27/01/2022, 21:42 - Sienna Lam: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 21:53 - Sienna Lam: How do I get a good photo for my new instagram with a mask
27/01/2022, 21:58 - Patsy Ng: with the electrical work safety banner, specifically?
27/01/2022, 21:58 - Sienna Lam: No
27/01/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: I do not have photography tips
27/01/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 22:05 - Patsy Ng: doesn't that take a ton of effort

mom makes some of the new year cakes from scratch every year and when lin go is one of them it takes ages

you have to like. steam it for hours and also stir it and since it's so thick it's exhausting to stir it
27/01/2022, 22:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Focus on lighting, no?
27/01/2022, 22:06 - Cindy Yang: oof
27/01/2022, 22:06 - Sienna Lam: Alright
27/01/2022, 22:06 - Sienna Lam: I’m running anyway so I am allowed to take off my mask
27/01/2022, 22:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 16 persona?
27/01/2022, 22:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah it'll be a weekend job I assume
27/01/2022, 22:08 - Patsy Ng: dope
27/01/2022, 22:08 - Patsy Ng: 15 spring
27/01/2022, 22:09 - Sienna Lam: Does freedom fighters refer to a specific freedom fighter or all freedom fighter
27/01/2022, 22:10 - Patsy Ng: generic freedom fighters i think
27/01/2022, 22:10 - Patsy Ng: if it meant a specific one it wouldn't be pluralized
27/01/2022, 22:12 - Patsy Ng: 8 get-together
27/01/2022, 22:24 - Sienna Lam: Mcdonalds salad without chicken: 100 calories
Mcdonalds salad with chicken: 250 calories
27/01/2022, 22:25 - Sienna Lam: I cheated on my diet and gained back 1 kilogram in 2 days
27/01/2022, 22:25 - Sienna Lam: I was literally 2 kilograms from being not overweight
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Merilyn Wong: :(( mm are u weighing urself at the same time every day
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Merilyn Wong: Cos weight fluctuates throughout the day
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Sienna Lam: Not really I wake up at different times
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Merilyn Wong: Ah ok thats prolly why
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Merilyn Wong: Dont worry
27/01/2022, 22:43 - Tara: What if you weigh yourself before eating breakfast
Does that work
27/01/2022, 22:44 - Sienna Lam: I do
27/01/2022, 23:04 - Rishibh Prakash: Fun coincidence: 5 in binary 101. The 5th letter of the alphabet is e which is encoded as 101 in ASCII (the lowercase letter at least)
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Oooo
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Wait what about the others
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Tara: a-e
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Patsy Ng: isn't that not a coincidence
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Yeah ^
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Patsy Ng: a is 0001
b is 0010
27/01/2022, 23:05 - Rishibh Prakash: No I mean a is 97, b is 98, c is 99 and so on
27/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Ohhh
27/01/2022, 23:06 - Rishibh Prakash: e is 101 because 96 + 5 = 101
27/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Ok cool
27/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Nice
27/01/2022, 23:06 - Patsy Ng: 01100101
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Tara: No u
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lol the new Piers Brosnan film that just came out flopped
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Rishibh Prakash: Similarly E is number 69 (nth letter is 64 +n)
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is particularly interesting bc
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Guess what we're going to el Charro on Monday
Exciting
27/01/2022, 23:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It was filmed in 2014 and it took them eight years to actually drop it bc it was that bad I guess
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Will be thinking of you guys 🤧
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Rishibh Prakash: Very exciting
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Rishibh Prakash: 😭
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But also probably they couldn't have released it in 2018 or too close to 2018
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Patsy Ng: huh we had nachos for lunch today and i was thinking about el charro's
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Patsy Ng: what a coincidence
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: On account of it starring Fan Bingbing
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: As a beautiful mermaid captured by an absolute monarch
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: I will order the nachos in your name
27/01/2022, 23:08 - Patsy Ng: 😔
27/01/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is awkward obviously because she disappeared in 2018 for three months due to Weird Circumstances Involving Tax Evasion
27/01/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And the movie got heavy Chinese investment so probably the coproducers in China didn't want to drop a film that involves Fan Bingbing getting kidnapped by the government
27/01/2022, 23:10 - Merilyn Wong: Ayt by the time im done cleaning this stinky dog i will be 20 so lemme give some closing remarks on my teenage years:
27/01/2022, 23:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Omg what
27/01/2022, 23:11 - Tara: Hey you're almost old now
27/01/2022, 23:12 - Cindy Yang: o sheet yea
27/01/2022, 23:12 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Patsy Ng: too late you're old now
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Yes it has been decreed
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: You old, girl
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Patsy Ng: tara you're next
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: No
27/01/2022, 23:13 - Patsy Ng: don't you mean: you old, woman
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: You old, gramma
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Cindy Yang: you old, lady
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: I'm trying to converse with someone but their messages are taking ages to load
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Which is annoying because I'm telling her about the nachos plan
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Cindy Yang: nachos?
27/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Yes I told them we're ordering nachos on Monday
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Merilyn Wong: * stop talking shit about people, once u stop participating in that nonsense ur heart will feel lighter i promise
* if u think everyone is watching everything ur doing, think again. Thats kind of a conceited outlook on life plus it gives u ✨anxiety✨
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: So I can feel nostalgic
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Patsy Ng: ooo wisdom
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: I feel wiser already
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Thank you ma'am
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Cindy Yang: wise words
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Wait what if it's my message that's not being sent
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: But I'm talking to yall
27/01/2022, 23:15 - Cindy Yang: probs on their end then
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Also next sem I'm taking a computer architecture course and we're gonna apparently be coding with assembly
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: So wish me luck it's gonna be fun
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Patsy Ng: ripppppp
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Cindy Yang: good luck
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Patsy Ng: i'm doing that this semester
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Ooh Twinsies
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: What else are you taking
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Patsy Ng: it's called "advanced programming projects" but that doesn't really tell you anything

it's a crash course in haskell and python
27/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: I'm taking
Circuits
Computer architecture
Network protocols
Signals and packets
And a humanities course
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Patsy Ng: we don't pick our stuff for next semester till the summer
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Ah options then?
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Patsy Ng: too many to remember
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Patsy Ng: but there's a networking one i want to take
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: love how you get all this cool stuff and I am paying to have an old lady explain what verbs are to me
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Cindy Yang: thought that said baseball for a second lol
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Nono as in you get to branch off into some specialty later?
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Patsy Ng: anyway back to meri's bday
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Merilyn Wong: * every time ur stomach feels like shit eat sth green
* coffee works
* the "best" way to study is sth thats fun for you
27/01/2022, 23:17 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
27/01/2022, 23:18 - Cindy Yang: o yea i have revised my opinion on 饿
27/01/2022, 23:18 - Patsy Ng: not explicitly

but the modules you take now affect what you can take later

and i think some of them clash so you inevitably end up specializing
27/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: How bout green Gatorade
27/01/2022, 23:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ooh do go on
27/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Nice
We've got the same thing here but it's more flexible
I'm taking an elec elective this semester
27/01/2022, 23:19 - Patsy Ng: green things:
- grass 
- rotten eggs
- rotten meat
- matcha (apparently some people hate it)
- really sour grapes
- a whole handful of raw dried herbs
27/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Grass sounds good
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Cindy Yang: i mean to basically what it was before lol, did not consider that 了 isn’t necessarily just for verbs
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Isn't #1 just standard anti yeet hay stuff
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Are you basically just an old Chinese lady
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Tara: Yes and it's wise
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 23:20 - Patsy Ng: funko pops
27/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: She's growing into her personality
27/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: /s
27/01/2022, 23:21 - Cindy Yang: although since 饿 is still a verb, it could still be interpreted that way, but most ppl wouldn’t think of it as one in this context
27/01/2022, 23:21 - Cindy Yang: delicious
27/01/2022, 23:22 - Merilyn Wong: * pet every dog u see (but ask first)
* it is always good to have baked goods in ur home, even if ur not the person that baked it
27/01/2022, 23:22 - Merilyn Wong: Hey its ur stomach not mine ://
27/01/2022, 23:22 - Cindy Yang: :) nice
27/01/2022, 23:22 - Patsy Ng: :)
27/01/2022, 23:22 - Patsy Ng: meri are you doing anything tomorrow then

27/01/2022, 23:23 - Patsy Ng: this has rishibh vibes
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: :)
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ageing
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: i also use question marks a lot more now
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oomf's gf uses it but only to be scary
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: technically we’re all doing that
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
27/01/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: fat oof
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: speak for yourself i haven't been alive since 2013
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Shskxjajx she's still typing
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: where is yuenyin atm
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Cindy Yang: rip
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: space clearly
27/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Idk presumably at home
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Has she tried changing her username
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or the chat topic
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: iirc the iss actually has decent wifi coverage sometimes
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Cindy Yang: wack
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: No her laptops WhatsApp ain't working
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: why don't y'all call her then
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Merilyn Wong: * The easiest way to maintain contact is sending memes, and then it also keeps the door open for future communication
* tell people when you enjoy their company/the sound of their voice/the text conversation u had. "It was super nice talking to you/hanging out with you", then everyone feels more secure about the interaction
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: how do you know
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Cindy Yang: aww nice
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: not over whatsapp over the actual phone
27/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: Because she's using her phone
27/01/2022, 23:26 - Cindy Yang: damb
27/01/2022, 23:26 - Cindy Yang: am got two bodyguards lmao
27/01/2022, 23:26 - Patsy Ng: https://www.sciencealert.com/the-iss-now-has-better-internet-than-most-of-us-after-its-latest-upgrade
27/01/2022, 23:28 - Merilyn Wong: * in order to stop panicking about problems, just think of what you're going to do next, like get some water or sth
* when ur going to someones place for the first time, bring something with you, like some grapes or sth
27/01/2022, 23:29 - Sienna Lam: What when
27/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Monday
27/01/2022, 23:29 - Merilyn Wong: * lastly, saying the words "i love you" a lot does not cheapen them at all, like I used to think. How can your love for others grow if you don't voice how much you love them?
27/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: 🤧
27/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: <Media omitted>

28/01/2022, 03:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sometimes
28/01/2022, 03:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: do you
28/01/2022, 03:38 - Cindy Yang: got it recently
28/01/2022, 03:38 - Cindy Yang: is there a way to make it auto cycle through study and break
28/01/2022, 03:55 - Patsy Ng: I have it on my laptop but only when get really really antsy and open tabs just to close them again
28/01/2022, 03:56 - Damien Fung: just got me booster 😎
28/01/2022, 04:02 - Cindy Yang: noicee
28/01/2022, 04:02 - Cindy Yang: damn
28/01/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no i don't think so? but like, is it really too much just to press one button?
28/01/2022, 04:20 - Patsy Ng: I don't think it's about convenience
28/01/2022, 04:21 - Patsy Ng: it's more like. a glorified schedule that makes itself easy to follow
28/01/2022, 04:21 - Patsy Ng: nice
28/01/2022, 04:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Even still, I think pressing the button to start work and break gives it finality
28/01/2022, 04:28 - Cindy Yang: i suppose
28/01/2022, 04:28 - Cindy Yang: yea
28/01/2022, 04:29 - Cindy Yang: like i feel like if you're the one pressing the button you could just. decide not to and fuck around more
28/01/2022, 04:29 - Cindy Yang: if it's scheduled then it forces you
28/01/2022, 04:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
28/01/2022, 04:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah but if you aren't the one that does how would you know
28/01/2022, 04:31 - Patsy Ng: probably yeah
28/01/2022, 04:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like, if it would just change from break mode to work mode you won't be able to tell unless you actively go and heck your forest
28/01/2022, 04:31 - Cindy Yang: i mean there are notifications
28/01/2022, 04:31 - Patsy Ng: ^
28/01/2022, 04:32 - Patsy Ng: also you'd know bc if it switched from break to work your mucking around window would suddenly be locked down
28/01/2022, 04:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk, I personally just need it to be a decision I made for it to be sth I hold myself to. if forest just automatically changed I probably wouldn't notice

ah lol it doesn't lock down my mucking about window because I run Forest on my phone and I use my computer for work
28/01/2022, 04:33 - Cindy Yang: i see
28/01/2022, 04:33 - Cindy Yang: to each their own i suppose
28/01/2022, 04:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also I always need a few seconds to collect myself before the switchover
28/01/2022, 04:33 - Patsy Ng: mm
28/01/2022, 04:34 - Patsy Ng: OK thank you for indirectly reminding me to get up and finish a prac
28/01/2022, 04:34 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
28/01/2022, 04:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: if it were like "lol btw we're in worktime" I would be like "what what the fuck i'm not ready" even if I actually was ready
28/01/2022, 04:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then I wouldn't be productive for the duration
28/01/2022, 04:35 - Cindy Yang: i see
28/01/2022, 04:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Anyway sorry I can't help with what you're trying to do
28/01/2022, 04:35 - Cindy Yang: it's aight
28/01/2022, 04:35 - Cindy Yang: pressing the button myself isn't so bad
28/01/2022, 04:36 - Patsy Ng: if you don't need the lock down I could try code sth that told you

Damien could probably do the entire thing, with the lockdown
28/01/2022, 04:37 - Cindy Yang: oo
28/01/2022, 04:37 - Cindy Yang: nah it's aight tho
28/01/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: there are other apps that do what i want
28/01/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: but without the funky tree growing 😔
28/01/2022, 04:38 - Patsy Ng: oof
28/01/2022, 04:41 - Damien Fung: ^ I'm sure there's a way to mod forest into doing what you want it to do
28/01/2022, 04:49 - Cindy Yang: hmm
28/01/2022, 04:49 - Cindy Yang: i see
28/01/2022, 04:49 - Cindy Yang: ehh it's not a big deal

28/01/2022, 12:07 - Damien Fung: 👀
28/01/2022, 12:07 - Cindy Yang: and then they started using it for new year
28/01/2022, 12:08 - Cindy Yang: so all the lines about winter ending and spring arriving are metaphorical

28/01/2022, 15:06 - Merilyn Wong: U trust that the goofy main character of the show takes u by the hand and reveals that their parents made them take dance lessons when they were younger
28/01/2022, 15:08 - Merilyn Wong: You step on their feet one or 2 times but they dont get mad at u and u realize that under the goofy exterior theyre just a big softy

28/01/2022, 23:48 - Tara: Wisdom nugs time
28/01/2022, 23:48 - Tara: * Don't feel like you're obligated to be friends with people you don't vibe with even if theoretically they're a great person.
* Always try to go beyond what's expected of you. You'll probably feel really accomplished / pleased afterwards.
* Drink more water!
* Believe in yourself! Don't be so negative even if you've hit a few snags.
* The ideal friend is someone who you would like to take over the world with.

29/01/2022, 01:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
29/01/2022, 01:10 - Cindy Yang: niceee

29/01/2022, 01:54 - Damien Fung: i'm p sure you already got the job with that
29/01/2022, 01:54 - Damien Fung: they seem interested in you
29/01/2022, 01:56 - Sienna Lam: In… what kind of way? 😏
29/01/2022, 01:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It helps that I've talked to this professor in the past specifically about my youtube work so they know I know how to do things
29/01/2022, 01:57 - Cindy Yang: sis
29/01/2022, 01:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: basically I decided to be as bold as possible in my cover letter
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so I was like
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Sienna Lam: 😫
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "we can yassify the youtube channel by becoming a breadtube channel"
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: (no not really)
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Sienna Lam: Blursed
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Sienna Lam: Bread tube is getting old though with contra and vaush ruining everything
29/01/2022, 01:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I pointed out examples of educational youtubers who have successfully built careers off of making research accessible by packaging it as question + answer format
29/01/2022, 01:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, you put a question in the title, you do research, and then you say what your research outcome was
29/01/2022, 01:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: As opposed to the current format which is
29/01/2022, 01:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like nobody's gonna click "Milo talks about his dissertation" because nobody has any idea who Milo is or what his dissertation is about (sorry milo you're a GOAT)
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Sienna Lam: Milo who?
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: exactly
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Sienna Lam: the fascist or someone else?
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no a student at my uni?
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's a uni channel
29/01/2022, 02:00 - Sienna Lam: Oh lol
29/01/2022, 02:01 - Sienna Lam: Well see if prof is interested in you in another way if you know what I mean 🙃
29/01/2022, 02:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: she is literally a lady
29/01/2022, 02:01 - Cindy Yang: getcha mind outta the gutter!!
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm saying that instead of presenting unedited interviews about academic minutiae as that, we could instead 

- create scripted videos that discuss the research outcomes of interesting papers, and include an interview section with the paper author
- format those videos so they're like "What is computer generated poetry?" in the title adn then "COmputer generated poetry is this / the implications of that are this" in the conclusion
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Sienna Lam: I flirt with men sometimes and I’m like… basically a lesbian
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because then people might actually click on them
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Cindy Yang: lmao
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Damien Fung: bruh what's with all the horniness lately lol
29/01/2022, 02:02 - Cindy Yang: uhhh some guy just asked for my number
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Sienna Lam: A scientific explanation is that my hormone levels changed
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Sienna Lam: I did a blood test and the estrogen is much higher, which is good
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Sienna Lam: But also, horny time
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: based oestrogen
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Damien Fung: bruh
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but cringe blood
29/01/2022, 02:03 - Damien Fung: block
29/01/2022, 02:04 - Sienna Lam: True. Though the type who is gonna watch a video essay probably wouldn’t mind if it were academic
29/01/2022, 02:05 - Cindy Yang: may have given it to him cos i was so bewildered 😬
29/01/2022, 02:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah the idea isn't to hide the academia, it's to structure things in a way where people are lured into watching them and come away feeling that they've been satisfied intellectually
29/01/2022, 02:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe he just wants to be besties
29/01/2022, 02:05 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
29/01/2022, 02:05 - Sienna Lam: Maybe he wants homework help
29/01/2022, 02:07 - Damien Fung: rip selvin
29/01/2022, 02:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the real issue is that they might expect me to host the videos and
29/01/2022, 02:07 - Cindy Yang: noooo
29/01/2022, 02:07 - Cindy Yang: if the guy texts i’m just gonna say nop
29/01/2022, 02:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: - either I would then have to directly link my youtube channel with my legal name and university (bad if I get in drama)
- or I would have to maintain two entirely separate lives on the exact same side of the internet and hope they never meet
29/01/2022, 02:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i am going to go full hannah montana
29/01/2022, 02:08 - Damien Fung: dude my friend got hit on like a million times right after she got a bf
29/01/2022, 02:08 - Cindy Yang: really

29/01/2022, 02:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: except with two pop stars catering to the same exact audience
29/01/2022, 02:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe it's the confidence
29/01/2022, 02:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh I just realised we've not seen the bf
29/01/2022, 02:09 - Sienna Lam: Me getting a bf just to get hit on /s

29/01/2022, 02:09 - Cindy Yang: this is the first time something like this has happened to me so i just froze up
29/01/2022, 02:09 - Damien Fung: we both agreed blocking them and not reading was the best course of action
29/01/2022, 02:09 - Cindy Yang: yea
29/01/2022, 02:10 - Cindy Yang: aight
29/01/2022, 02:10 - Damien Fung: nah they got together around when school went online again so the people knew her from last term's courses

29/01/2022, 02:16 - Cindy Yang: dope
29/01/2022, 02:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I really wanna see if I can get us even like, a meagre morsel of clout

29/01/2022, 22:25 - Sienna Lam: Why mysterio is the sorcerer supreme in Andrew Garfield’s universe
29/01/2022, 22:28 - Sienna Lam: 1st. Jake gyllenhall is too good of an actor to just kill off.
2nd. There has to be a sorcerer supreme in Andrew Garfield’s universe because otherwise dormammu would have destroyed it
3rd. Mysterio never appeared in Sony’s spider man, and they like using MCU and raimi characters

30/01/2022, 10:13 - Damien Fung: i think it'd be best if you either do this or just stick with a single character word
30/01/2022, 10:14 - Damien Fung: just for simplicity
30/01/2022, 10:14 - Patsy Ng: i'm leaving it blank for now

Straights owned
30/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Oh nay guess Char and Damien will just perish
30/01/2022, 21:11 - Sienna Lam: Become ace and follow the true path of celibacy
30/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Love the sample size too
30/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: 100 is definitely not small
30/01/2022, 21:13 - Tara: /s pls don't
30/01/2022, 21:13 - Tara: be Happy
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Sienna Lam: Char and damen becoming a couple
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Tara: Sienna stop shipping people who are already in relationships
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Tara: It's weird
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Sienna Lam: Alright
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Tara: And even professor / students??
30/01/2022, 21:14 - Tara: how is that ever appropriate
30/01/2022, 21:15 - Sienna Lam: Ship myself with Xi jinping
30/01/2022, 21:18 - Patsy Ng: why char?
30/01/2022, 21:19 - Sienna Lam: If students are adults there’s nothing wrong imo
30/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: sorry just lumped people in relationships together
30/01/2022, 21:20 - Patsy Ng: nah but there's that power imbalance
30/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: ^^
30/01/2022, 21:20 - Sienna Lam: That’s the case in every straight relationship
30/01/2022, 21:20 - Sienna Lam: So are those wrong too?
30/01/2022, 21:21 - Patsy Ng: (you literally just posted a link saying that straight relationships are bad for people)
30/01/2022, 21:21 - Sienna Lam: They’re bad for you but they’re not wrong per se. Just like gaming is bad for you but not wrong
30/01/2022, 21:22 - Sienna Lam: Otherwise Rich cannot date poor, cis cannot date trans, etc.
30/01/2022, 21:22 - Patsy Ng: i feel like this is false equivalency but i can't elaborate how gimme a bit
30/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: Wait before this becomes worse
30/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: Sienna is there an underlying problem you want to discuss
30/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: Or is it just straight relationships = bad
30/01/2022, 21:24 - Tara: because if there is please just cut to the point
30/01/2022, 21:25 - Sienna Lam: Cant really trust relationships IMO cuz they’re gonna like always end up in some sort of dependency
30/01/2022, 21:25 - Patsy Ng: in a teacher-student relationship there is some element of pastoral care

like with school-age students the teacher is in loco parentis

which is different from a normal power imbalance, because a teacher has a responsibility to treat students like their own kids, to an extent

even if uni prof-student relationships don't have the in loco parentis thing, there's still a kind of pastoral care thing (like they can refer you to student services for mental health stuff, etc)

so turning the relationship into a romantic/sexual one is sort of. corrupting that agreement
30/01/2022, 21:25 - Tara: oh my GOD sienna 
arguing with you is so exhausting
why can't you just _tell_ us the problem
30/01/2022, 21:26 - Sienna Lam: No not really.
30/01/2022, 21:26 - Patsy Ng: that is just how being a person works

if you care about people then there's some give and take
30/01/2022, 21:26 - Tara: yeah exactly
30/01/2022, 21:26 - Sienna Lam: I hate sex cuz it feels wrong
30/01/2022, 21:27 - Sienna Lam: Maybe that’s the underlying issue?
30/01/2022, 21:27 - Patsy Ng: ok that's a you thing

sex is unpleasant for you

that doesn't mean anything about its value to other people
30/01/2022, 21:28 - Sienna Lam: I love gay men they’re the best
30/01/2022, 21:29 - Sienna Lam: Also, don’t really want to ever enter a relationship cuz like too much inequality inside the relationship.
30/01/2022, 21:31 - Tara: there doesn't have to be
As Pat said, there's always some give or take
If you establish boundaries and stand up for them then you'll be happier i guess
30/01/2022, 21:31 - Tara: but it's your choice
30/01/2022, 21:31 - Tara: please just stop dragging other groups of people into it
30/01/2022, 21:34 - Sienna Lam: Sorry just sick of straight men because, I don’t understand them. Cuz it’s sort of like, they’re dating someone weaker than them which is like, a bit of a questionable thing. Like isn’t it more manly to date another man because at least he’s your equal.
30/01/2022, 21:34 - Merilyn Wong: Idk this has the energy of when ppl say "the blacks" or "the gays"
30/01/2022, 21:35 - Merilyn Wong: Well obv not all straight men are like this, if you had some specific examples then id love to hear it
30/01/2022, 21:35 - Merilyn Wong: But you're generalizing a bit much friend
30/01/2022, 21:36 - Sienna Lam: Women are weaker than men in terms of the gender hierarchy
30/01/2022, 21:36 - Sienna Lam: So like, dating women when you’re higher in the gender hierarchy means you’re dating someone weaker.
30/01/2022, 21:37 - Patsy Ng: i think you're focusing too much on. imbalance. 

you're interpreting people's actions with bad faith and. i guess you can do that but it just makes your world super miserable
30/01/2022, 21:37 - Merilyn Wong: Plus it could be about taking on a protector role
30/01/2022, 21:39 - Sienna Lam: I generally assume the worst of people cuz then I’ll never be disappointed. If I’m wrong then it’s a pleasant suprise
30/01/2022, 21:42 - Merilyn Wong: This pessimistic outlook on life is more hurtful than actually meeting bad people at this point in our lives
30/01/2022, 21:42 - Sienna Lam: Thing is, I feel like people are just dragging me around and making everything weird in me. Cuz they first say I should date women and now I’m supposed to date men. Like literally I would have been straight if I were a cis women
30/01/2022, 21:43 - Sienna Lam: But I don’t wanna deal with men because they remind me of everything I hate about myself. Especially people think it’s unreasonable for me to dislike mens bodies. But of course I do because literally hating my own body for most of my life. I can’t just stop just cuz I’m supposed to like men.
30/01/2022, 21:45 - Merilyn Wong: Then dont like men! Thats fine!
30/01/2022, 21:45 - Merilyn Wong: U needa stop trying to justify yourself to every single person around you bc no matter who you are or what you do youll never please 100% of people 100% of the time
30/01/2022, 21:55 - Tara: Sienna you should try to give people a chance
30/01/2022, 21:56 - Tara: It'll make you much happier
30/01/2022, 21:56 - Tara: Now that we're on this topic
30/01/2022, 21:56 - Tara: We need to find you uni friends
30/01/2022, 21:57 - Patsy Ng: yooo i just saw a seagull swoop past my window
30/01/2022, 21:57 - Tara: ooh did it steal stuff /s
30/01/2022, 21:57 - Patsy Ng: no
30/01/2022, 21:57 - Patsy Ng: but on the compsci discord some first year was talking about how a seagull stole their laptop

which is questionable since the laptop undoubtedly weighs more than a single seagull
30/01/2022, 21:57 - Tara: You should join be our guest
30/01/2022, 21:58 - Tara: and lmao sandeepti befriended yuen yin because they were in the same student ambassador interview
30/01/2022, 21:58 - Tara: hahahah
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: what is this

some beauty and the beast appreciation club, with a focus on lumiere?
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Tara: big doubt
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Tara: i think it's like
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Tara: some cultural society
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Tara: basically a way to meet people
30/01/2022, 21:59 - Sienna Lam: Sure
30/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: by the end of the semester your new friends will meet mine
30/01/2022, 22:02 - Patsy Ng: ominous
30/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: not that they're two mutually exclusive groups
30/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: you know what i mean

30/01/2022, 22:36 - Cindy Yang: 😔
30/01/2022, 22:37 - Cindy Yang: got caught thinking the second was an adverb
30/01/2022, 23:28 - Cindy Yang: i think my name in the school cafe is just sydney now 😫
30/01/2022, 23:47 - Sienna Lam: Cidney
30/01/2022, 23:47 - Sienna Lam: Cidny
31/01/2022, 00:02 - Cindy Yang: indeed
31/01/2022, 00:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i appreciate that you're shorter than me but 60kg would likely be underweight, no?
31/01/2022, 00:11 - Sienna Lam: Then I can do weight cycling though which would mean I could get more curvy
31/01/2022, 00:11 - Patsy Ng: i was thinking that too bc i'm about 55 kg give or take a few and sienna has like. at least a head and shoulders on me
31/01/2022, 00:11 - Patsy Ng: *head and neck

martini is the one with a head and shoulders on me
31/01/2022, 00:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I haven't measured my weight in ages but I'd estimate I'm at around 70 right now
31/01/2022, 00:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I was 80 when I lived at home and I'm a good deal skinnier now
31/01/2022, 00:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If Pat is almost 60 and I'm over 70 somewhere
31/01/2022, 00:13 - Cindy Yang: i was like, around 60ish last time i measured
31/01/2022, 00:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It stands to reason that a reasonable goal for Sienna would be sixty-something, so sixty is pushing it
31/01/2022, 00:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Based only on height and not taking gender disparities into account
31/01/2022, 00:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In any case, I am not an expert and you should consult with your doctor next time it's possible

31/01/2022, 03:44 - Patsy Ng: also @12369716003 doing a groupwork module this semester so you'll be pleased to know i've been forced to learn git

(of a sort)

only staff/postgrads get access to uni git so we undergrad plebs have to use mercurial

i spent most of friday figuring out how to use it but now i know how the basics work it's not as stressful as i thought it would be

but that's probably bc i haven't had to deal with any conflicts yet
31/01/2022, 03:54 - Damien Fung: nice nice

01/02/2022, 23:19 - Patsy Ng: groups got released last wednesday and we were supposed to meet on friday as per lecturer's suggestion, i texted on thursday to ask if they wanted to meet up, they ignored my texts (and this was on teams and we had lectures on teams on both thursday and friday so i Know they saw it), so i decided to set up mercurial by myself bc it doesn't really "count" towards work yet so i could do it myself, so i emailed on sunday with the mercurial details and they also did not respond

then we had a tutorial on monday and teammate 1 finally communicated with me (but teammate 2 hasn't been to either of our two tutorials so far), said that they hadn't responded bc they were busy catching up on lectures (but like. there's only two compsci modules and the other one is compulsory so. binch me too you don't see me using that as an excuse)

but then teammate 1 and i spent an hour afterwards sorting out who was gonna do what so i was like "hmm maybe they actually will do Good Work" 

so i'm now working on it today and i just pulled their changes bc they did stuff this morning and It Won't Compile bc the code they pushed is Chock Full of Errors

i tried fixing it but as soon as i fix an error, more pop up

and they fucking did the group project module last year and i didn't! didn't they learn not to push broken stuff???
01/02/2022, 23:20 - Patsy Ng: wait how is that my vibe

04/02/2022, 12:16 - Tara: From Golden Girls
04/02/2022, 12:19 - Sienna Lam: dude im auditing this course and they let you bring the notes into the exam???
04/02/2022, 12:20 - Tara: Oh you haven't taken any open book course yet?
04/02/2022, 12:20 - Sienna Lam: chem was but the final exam wsa closed book
04/02/2022, 13:47 - Tara: hahaha my sim tried turning another sim into an object but she turned into a suit of armour instead
04/02/2022, 15:08 - Sienna Lam: Do they have trans sims I.e. your sim can transition in game
04/02/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Nope but there's probably a mod for it
04/02/2022, 15:17 - Tara: Oh one second
04/02/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Nvm
04/02/2022, 15:18 - Tara: https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Morgyn_Ember
04/02/2022, 15:18 - Tara: CAS has some more options
04/02/2022, 15:21 - Sienna Lam: see being trans gives u magic
04/02/2022, 15:45 - Merilyn Wong: Lmao like pull up the cangjie keyboard, type ur name and see what u get

唘
04/02/2022, 16:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, you can specifically choose whether a sim can get pregnant, impregnate, how they use the toilet, pronouns, build etc at creation, but a sim can't later transition iirc
04/02/2022, 16:11 - Sienna Lam: what if there was this super skilled cis woman who could pee standing up
04/02/2022, 16:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: then you can create a sim that has female pronouns, a feminine model, the ability to get pregnant,e tc, but pees standing up, and make that your headcanon
04/02/2022, 16:13 - Sienna Lam: i dont think u can make a sim pregnatn and standing up
04/02/2022, 16:13 - Sienna Lam: and pee standing up
04/02/2022, 16:13 - Tara: you can
04/02/2022, 16:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think I have before when messing around with the systems
04/02/2022, 16:13 - Tara: they're two separate options
04/02/2022, 16:14 - Tara: not mutually exclusive according to the game
04/02/2022, 16:14 - Sienna Lam: if u set to 'pees standing up' it makes your sim has a masxuline voice
04/02/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe by default but you can choose any voice iirc
04/02/2022, 16:15 - Tara: oh what i thought all voices were available to everyone
04/02/2022, 16:15 - Sienna Lam: i tried to choose a female voice it just made a masculine chirpy vopice
04/02/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
04/02/2022, 16:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: on sims 4?
04/02/2022, 16:17 - Sienna Lam: ye
04/02/2022, 16:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: From what I've read you can assign voice regardless of gender, but I'm not sure
04/02/2022, 16:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Are you sure it correlates specifically to how they pee?
04/02/2022, 16:18 - Sienna Lam: i think so but idont remember that wekk
04/02/2022, 16:18 - Sienna Lam: well
04/02/2022, 16:19 - Tara: it shouldn't
04/02/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh TIL they're adding custom pronouns
04/02/2022, 16:19 - Tara: are you also reading the wikia
04/02/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/customizable-pronouns-coming-to-the-sims-4
04/02/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I am and also reddit threads for individual experiences
04/02/2022, 16:20 - Sienna Lam: Adults of each gender now have two separate voices, chosen automatically by the game upon the Sim's birth or creation in Create a Sim. The player cannot control which voice the Sim is given, though it is possible to change a Sim's voice using SimPE.[n 1] It is also possible for experienced players to identify the voice of their Sim in Create a Sim before they have confirmed their creation.[5] Gerri Lawlor and Stephen Kearin return, voicing female and male sims, respectively.[6] Stephen Kearin is also the voice of certain NPCs, such as ideal plantsim, Rod Humble, Unsavory Charlatan, and Bigfoot (NPC).[n 2] They are joined by Zoe Galvez, and Dave Boat, who voices certain NPCs such as the Genie and Bigfoot.

04/02/2022, 16:20 - Tara: Sis that's sims 2
04/02/2022, 16:21 - Sienna Lam: https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Voice
04/02/2022, 16:21 - Tara: Or 1 I forgot
04/02/2022, 16:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think by choosing a voice option and messing with the sliders you can make any two sims of any gender speak the same way
04/02/2022, 16:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's just the defaults which will be different depending on gender
04/02/2022, 16:22 - Tara: Wait I'm playing TS4 I'll just edit a sim and get back to you
04/02/2022, 16:23 - Tara: Oh yeah all voices are available
04/02/2022, 16:23 - Tara: Regardless of gender
04/02/2022, 16:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Have you tried using the same voice for two differently gendered sims?
04/02/2022, 16:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Specifically check the default setting of the pitch slider, and whether changing it to the same one for both yields the same result
04/02/2022, 16:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If so it ought to be pretty cut and dry
04/02/2022, 16:24 - Tara: Yes
Same voice
04/02/2022, 16:24 - Sienna Lam: i dont think i have sims installed on this computer
04/02/2022, 16:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sorted then, you have a variety of options for transgender sims just as long as you're okay contextualising them in terms of the gender binary
04/02/2022, 16:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
04/02/2022, 16:26 - Tara: Nice
04/02/2022, 16:26 - Tara: I wonder what TS5 has in store for us
04/02/2022, 16:26 - Sienna Lam: making every sim nonbinary she/they tbh
04/02/2022, 16:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh I think they'll just keep updating TS4 for the next decade or so like minecraft
04/02/2022, 16:27 - Tara: At this point idc about the actual game i just want to garden
04/02/2022, 16:27 - Tara: it's been Weeks I want perfect produce
04/02/2022, 16:27 - Sienna Lam: also, all the men can get pregnant but cant get others pregnant
04/02/2022, 16:27 - Damien Fung: wasn't TS4 released like a decade ago
04/02/2022, 16:27 - Damien Fung: i don't think they're gonna make a new one
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah why redo the engine if it technically works
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: minecrap is overrated tbh
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: they should add magic and tech
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: at least redstone themed tech
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: go outside and buy a shovel then duh
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: and magic fits right in
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they have both to a certain extent
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: like, add rpgstyle abilities that cost xp
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Damien Fung: take advantage of technological development?
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Damien Fung: and also legacy code is hard to work with
04/02/2022, 16:28 - Sienna Lam: paradox irl
04/02/2022, 16:29 - Sienna Lam: using the same engine since 2008 or smth
04/02/2022, 16:29 - Tara: 2014(?) or 13
04/02/2022, 16:29 - Tara: omg yeah it's been a decade
04/02/2022, 16:29 - Tara: fuck off
04/02/2022, 16:30 - Sienna Lam: huh
04/02/2022, 16:30 - Tara: not talking to yall
04/02/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's a generic fuck off at EA
04/02/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
04/02/2022, 16:31 - Tara: hahaha
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: it do be like that
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: also i did a bunch of research into potential job places
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: and turns out i don't *need need* a masters
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nice, any good options?
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: bc it only really increases my range by like 10%
04/02/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: honestly if you manage to get a job right off the bat even if it's not amazing, you can get more jobs off of that experience
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: 60% of the jobs out there are cool with a bsc
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Sienna Lam: u should learn for the sake of learning
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Tara: if you want to
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: and the other 30 prefer or need a PHD
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Tara: if you don't need to and you don't want to
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: an entire masters just to get your foot in the door isn't worth it unless you specifically want one
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: i should but i also have to consider how hard it is to get in
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Tara: then No
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Sienna Lam: gun for that
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: ye so i'm banking on coop to pivot me into a good job
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Sienna Lam: they pay you to learn phd
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Tara: it's more a realisation that i've been playing this for ten years
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: no i really don't wanna do a phd
04/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: as cool as it would be
04/02/2022, 16:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "you want a masters for employment or self improvement, I want a masters because I want praise, we are not the same"
04/02/2022, 16:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nonbinary person who gets a phd so they never have to get called mr or miss ever again
04/02/2022, 16:36 - Tara: good luck
04/02/2022, 16:36 - Damien Fung: anywho job prospects with bsc
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Damien Fung: are crazy good
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they ought to let people with a masters be called "Master x"
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Damien Fung: i can go from startups
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Damien Fung: to most microsoft ds roles
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Tara: agreed
04/02/2022, 16:37 - Sienna Lam: Prof: "I honestly think E-reader is better than Ipad' 
Me taking notes on ipad:
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: but what really catches my eye are the number of game companies i can apply for
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: i can go for riot and get all my expenses paid for relocation and everything
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Tara: take down EA from the inside /s
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: and they fund my gaming hobbies too
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: speaking of EA
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: that's also an option and they also give you EA gaming credits
04/02/2022, 16:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: rito games paying you to spend the money on rito again
04/02/2022, 16:40 - Damien Fung: but i don't like EA so no for me
04/02/2022, 16:40 - Damien Fung: yessir
04/02/2022, 16:40 - Tara: speaking of academics or whatever they've officially approved of my minor
04/02/2022, 16:40 - Tara: in big data technology
04/02/2022, 16:40 - Damien Fung: oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
04/02/2022, 16:41 - Damien Fung: what courses do you get to take
04/02/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: remembering how i got into compsci because Iw as like "i wanna do game dev" and now I cba to code anything at all
04/02/2022, 16:41 - Damien Fung: i have the option of taking the big data course but don't think i'll do it bc it's not as interesting for me
04/02/2022, 16:41 - Damien Fung: mood
04/02/2022, 16:41 - Damien Fung: except i'm just making data pipelines now
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Damien Fung: VISUALIZATION
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: am i the one person here who made it out of stem lol
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Tara: No I've secretly left STEM
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Damien Fung: my true love
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Tara: And this minor is a big sham
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: data vis data vis pretty graphs pretty graphs
04/02/2022, 16:42 - Damien Fung: wait what
04/02/2022, 16:43 - Tara: I'm joking
04/02/2022, 16:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: friendship over with STEM, now CRIME is my best friend
04/02/2022, 16:43 - Damien Fung: we makin all the pretty graphs with all the funky libraries
04/02/2022, 16:43 - Tara: Don't you mean crime brulee
04/02/2022, 16:43 - Damien Fung: ggplot2 superiority
04/02/2022, 16:44 - Tara: So mini problem
They changed the prerequisite requirements for ML
I've taken COMP2011 but they now need COMP2012
Which I am Not taking
04/02/2022, 16:44 - Tara: So I have to take data mining
04/02/2022, 16:44 - Damien Fung: whazat
04/02/2022, 16:44 - Tara: Which reduces the number of electives I can take 👍
04/02/2022, 16:44 - Tara: COMP2011 is C++
COMP2012 is advanced C++ which I don't need for my degree
04/02/2022, 16:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: c+++
04/02/2022, 16:45 - Tara: Yes exactly C+++
04/02/2022, 16:46 - Tara: Anyway now I just need to pray that I get into these courses later
04/02/2022, 16:46 - Tara: Or else I'm Fucked
04/02/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: o o f
04/02/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: i mean
04/02/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: you might as well have it right?
04/02/2022, 16:48 - Damien Fung: isn't c++ really useful for some ml libraries where you can't use python?
04/02/2022, 16:48 - Damien Fung: and for legacy systems too
04/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: I could take it
04/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: Ugh
04/02/2022, 16:49 - Tara: I have 2/3 extra slots
04/02/2022, 16:49 - Tara: Hmmmm
04/02/2022, 16:49 - Tara: I will consider this
04/02/2022, 16:52 - Sienna Lam: this is so dumb, fundamentals of analytical chemistry is a chem major requirement but analytical chemistry isnt??
04/02/2022, 18:00 - Patsy Ng: i think you can do that. if you enable cheats

which ea encourages bc it just makes the game easier and more fun
04/02/2022, 18:01 - Tara: no related cheat but there's gotta be a mod
04/02/2022, 18:02 - Tara: I know there's a pregnancy for everyone mod
04/02/2022, 18:03 - Patsy Ng: no that cheat that lets you have the create-a-sim editor when modifying existing sims
04/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: ohh
04/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: cas.fulleditmode
04/02/2022, 18:04 - Patsy Ng: also I pulled an almost-all-nighter to work on compsci stuff and guess what. I learned I start hallucinating smurfs when. I'm sleep. deprived enough
04/02/2022, 18:04 - Merilyn Wong: Hmmmmmm
04/02/2022, 18:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the Arden version of Measure For Measure is so thicc
04/02/2022, 18:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't remember the Arden Othello being this thicc
04/02/2022, 19:40 - Patsy Ng: got less than two hours of sleep and I also had three cups of tea by 10:00 so my attention span and short term memory are shot and I've taken to writing reminders of what I'm doing next on the window like I'm that guy in memento
04/02/2022, 19:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like... a to do list?
04/02/2022, 19:42 - Patsy Ng: yeah but for what I'm am literally doing Right Now
04/02/2022, 19:42 - Patsy Ng: as in i'll be staring at my code and forgetting what I'm doing
04/02/2022, 19:42 - Tara: Like
04/02/2022, 19:42 - Tara: Sleep
04/02/2022, 19:42 - Tara: Wait it's not done?m
04/02/2022, 19:43 - Patsy Ng: no I have to get this done by this afternoon bc there aren't lab help sessions until next Tuesday and this is due on wednesday
04/02/2022, 21:29 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
04/02/2022, 21:30 - Cindy Yang: o dear
04/02/2022, 21:43 - Patsy Ng: good news I'm no longer tired

bad news is bc I'm Filled With Adrenaline

good news is bc I finished a really big part of the project which I've been stuck. on for the last three days

bad news is it's also bc i tried merging the commits with the solution but the solution meant I had to change Every Single File so there are So Many Conflicts and mercurial decided the way to handle them was to yeet all my changes and I just spent the most stressful 15 mins of today undoing the undoes
04/02/2022, 21:53 - Merilyn Wong: Thats 2 good and 2 bad news, p solid ratio
04/02/2022, 21:54 - Patsy Ng: about to be 3 good news after lunch bc I'm going to figure out how to merge it all properly
04/02/2022, 22:03 - Cindy Yang: thats the spirit

didn't read it until i actually got to his office, so i ran back to my dorm to make it back and not be too late

which was. kind of fun actually bc i managed to cut the time it takes to travel between the cs building and my dorm in half (google maps says it takes 7 mins, but i did it in 4)

05/02/2022, 05:21 - Damien Fung: maybe the tea you're getting has less caffeine ?
05/02/2022, 05:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That's likely, and the way I prepare it should affect that too (multiple steeps of the same leaves)
05/02/2022, 05:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's certainly different in taste to bag tea
05/02/2022, 05:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And bag tea Affects me more

any pronouns are fine, unless i'm being introduced to a new person in which case it's they/them (so they're not biased by whatever pronouns you use)

but yeah it's more about. the intent behind the pronouns i think

like. if someone insists on using "she/her" it is Worse than like. the weirdest apartment people using "she/her"
06/02/2022, 22:47 - Patsy Ng: have more of a problem with being assigned gendered modes of address/titles

07/02/2022, 13:45 - Cindy Yang: 🦫
07/02/2022, 13:45 - Tara: People would trade Maggi or something
07/02/2022, 13:45 - Damien Fung: oh yeah
07/02/2022, 13:45 - Tara: Like they would trade the noodles and seasoning separately
07/02/2022, 13:45 - Damien Fung: i turned into a loan shark against harshul
07/02/2022, 13:45 - Cindy Yang: lmao

07/02/2022, 13:46 - Tara: Calm down Maggi is noodles too
07/02/2022, 13:46 - Damien Fung: i gave him the remains of the mamee seasoning and i held it to him until year 7 where he bought me siu mai
07/02/2022, 13:46 - Tara: The inferior indomie
07/02/2022, 13:46 - Merilyn Wong: Ok now that im 30% less sad
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Cindy Yang: lmao nice
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Merilyn Wong: I went to put my 2 herniated eggs into a bowl and dropped one on the counter
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Cindy Yang: oof
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Merilyn Wong: And i soft boiled them
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Cindy Yang: herniated lol
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: rip
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: yom
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Merilyn Wong: So the yolk spilled out onto the counter
07/02/2022, 13:47 - Merilyn Wong: And then i had 1 less edible egg
07/02/2022, 13:48 - Damien Fung: noooooo
07/02/2022, 13:48 - Merilyn Wong: And i had to also clean
07/02/2022, 13:48 - Damien Fung: lick it off the counter

07/02/2022, 13:48 - Tara: Slorp
07/02/2022, 13:48 - Merilyn Wong: No
07/02/2022, 13:50 - Merilyn Wong: Btw whats left of the surviving egg is delicious
07/02/2022, 13:51 - Damien Fung: dude when i made my first batch of ramen eggs after i peeled them like 40% of the egg white survived
07/02/2022, 13:51 - Cindy Yang: nice
07/02/2022, 14:08 - Merilyn Wong: Gonna scream why my aunts here
07/02/2022, 14:17 - Cindy Yang: o oof
07/02/2022, 14:17 - Cindy Yang: offer her some egg
07/02/2022, 15:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
07/02/2022, 16:03 - Sienna Lam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People
07/02/2022, 16:05 - Patsy Ng: pet him for me
07/02/2022, 16:07 - Patsy Ng: idk go along and find out
07/02/2022, 16:15 - Tara: JHkjhfkj they want us to refer to a textbook published in 1997
07/02/2022, 16:15 - Tara: it's not the wis thing it's uni stuff
07/02/2022, 19:00 - Patsy Ng: my tutor has covid (which is Really Upsetting) so my tutorial group had to join up with another tutorial group

and the other tutor was the bodybuilder tutor I had last year

and we got 7 mins into the tutorial and he instantly assigned me Nerd (idk if he remembered me)
07/02/2022, 19:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oof
07/02/2022, 19:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: assigned nerd at birth
07/02/2022, 19:23 - Patsy Ng: it wasn't just that

i answered the first question bc like. you know how no-one ever wants to go first and it's just. really tiring to just Wait

then a couple questions later no-one else was answering again and then we all indicated we had answers at the same time and he looked at me and went "Not You again, someone else this time" even though i'd said like One Thing previously and then i made a face bc that was just Confusing and hopefully no-one else saw bc i was at the front (everyone in my class is a Giant) and also wearing a mask
07/02/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh yeah
07/02/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I have a lot of classes that are just
07/02/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: mainly silent except me
07/02/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I hate it because I don't want to seem like a showoff
07/02/2022, 19:36 - Patsy Ng: yeah
07/02/2022, 19:37 - Patsy Ng: usually if i answer tons of questions i also try ask some questions so i don't look like a know-it-all
07/02/2022, 19:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: might revive the rpg system where you play as scouts and you get to pick badges
07/02/2022, 19:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: at least just for the meme value
07/02/2022, 20:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
07/02/2022, 20:05 - Patsy Ng: hey remember how there was a covid safety badg
07/02/2022, 20:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh fr?
07/02/2022, 20:05 - Patsy Ng: yeah
07/02/2022, 20:06 - Patsy Ng: none of us got it bc. well. it was released in february and we'd have essentially left by may
07/02/2022, 20:08 - Patsy Ng: but yeah the hk scout association wanted to promote hygiene so they made a like. covid safety badge

i think some of the tasks were to like. clean your house? and like remember that thing about covid coming through toilets? i think one task was to fix your toilet's u-bend or sth

iirc another was to make a psa poster and hang it up somewhere?
07/02/2022, 20:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: would be a funny pick for the game tbh
07/02/2022, 20:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "What are your skill proficiencies?"
"I can swordfight, I can create maps of the local area, and I can fix a toilet U-bend"
07/02/2022, 20:13 - Patsy Ng: hhhh
07/02/2022, 20:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think it would be fun to have it be procedurally generated, like the DM gets a randomly generated list of 

- one major threat
- one minor threat
- three activities available on the campsite
- the weather for two days
07/02/2022, 20:14 - Patsy Ng: ooh funky
07/02/2022, 20:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: esp. if you luck out and get like, archery or pioneering
07/02/2022, 20:19 - Patsy Ng: it would be fun if the probabilities could be affected by a campsite that you select, or you generate the campsite first and then the rest are affected

and have the campsites based on real ones

like gilwell would have like. 50% chance of cold & rain, and a threat could be monkeys, ham tin would have a high chance of a threat being horseflies or wild boars, and grass island could have Hungry Thieving Cows
07/02/2022, 20:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What are some issues that could arise during a scout camp?
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think six possible major villains. One vampires for tradition reasons
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The rest could be
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Sienna Lam: James
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk, witches are fun because running water.
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Sienna Lam: Genghis khan
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: James would be categorised as Minor Nuisance
07/02/2022, 20:32 - Sienna Lam: Ante pavelic
07/02/2022, 20:33 - Sienna Lam: (Don’t Google him)
07/02/2022, 20:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Six potential nuisances including boar food theft
07/02/2022, 20:33 - Sienna Lam: Osman the great
07/02/2022, 20:33 - Sienna Lam: Winston Churchill
07/02/2022, 20:34 - Sienna Lam: Red guard detachment
07/02/2022, 20:34 - Patsy Ng: werewolf

just cause we played it a lot
07/02/2022, 20:35 - Sienna Lam: Horse
07/02/2022, 20:35 - Sienna Lam: American in a bear costume with a gun (the right to bear arms)
07/02/2022, 20:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ooh yeah good idea
07/02/2022, 20:35 - Sienna Lam: Grizzly bear who is intelligent and a nazi and has a gun
07/02/2022, 20:35 - Patsy Ng: the first time I went to the sjd camp in year 4 like everyone got homesickness

mainly bc it was right after year 4 camp so we went straight from that to gilwell
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What if one possible nuisance is another rival troop having picked the same site
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Patsy Ng: oooh yeah
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meaning you have to deal with them being annoying while also having to deal with the main threat
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Sienna Lam: Make it scouts vs red guards haha
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Patsy Ng: that's how you make it competitive multiplayer
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Sienna Lam: So the red guards vandalise ur tents with mao posters
07/02/2022, 20:36 - Sienna Lam: and then u vandalise theirs with Churchill posters
07/02/2022, 20:37 - Sienna Lam: then you get into a fist fight and there’s this massive brawl
07/02/2022, 20:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: - Vampires
- Witches
- Werewolves
- Zombies
- Cult meeting
- Serial killer?
07/02/2022, 20:37 - Sienna Lam: Cereal killer
07/02/2022, 20:37 - Sienna Lam: He burns down cereal factories
07/02/2022, 20:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Then nuisances would be:

- Food stolen in the night by boars
- The campsite was double booked and another group demands the spot
- James insisted on accompanying you and refuses to believe in anything supernatural
- non food items keep getting mysteriously stolen
- All the campsite facilities are broken
- Surprise! Night hike!
07/02/2022, 20:42 - Sienna Lam: The food is rotten
07/02/2022, 20:42 - Sienna Lam: Cuz someone brought fresh fish
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Patsy Ng: nah
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Weather:
- Typhoon
- Rain
- Rain
- Rain
- Rain
- Clear skies!
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Patsy Ng: Frozen Oil
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oooh yeah, frozen food could be one
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Sienna Lam: Snow
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Patsy Ng: forgot blazing sun heatstroke in an hour
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Sienna Lam: Remember that mountain in HK100
07/02/2022, 20:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Tru
07/02/2022, 20:48 - Patsy Ng: hmm I think a really creepy element would be like. if the stars were sentient and just. silently watched you all the time
07/02/2022, 20:48 - Sienna Lam: Bruh moment
07/02/2022, 20:48 - Sienna Lam: Chairman mao’s face is emblazoned on the sun
07/02/2022, 20:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and it didn't actually affect anything they were just vibing?
07/02/2022, 20:52 - Patsy Ng: I mean that's an option

maybe like. if you have the astro badge you can talk to them and they'll respond if they feel like it (but they're just generally very cryptic and unhelpful)
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: Add customisable classes
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: So we’d replace subclasses with ‘class archetypes’ that determine the base mechanics of a class
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: and normal class features with ‘class feats’ that you could select like from 3 at each level
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: And the class traditions, the base framework for the class
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The only customisable class you need to worry about
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Patsy Ng: I like the classlessness of this system
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Is your IGCSEs smh
07/02/2022, 20:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just proficiency badges
07/02/2022, 20:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Would be a funny gag if all of the character sheets had a "class" section and you had to be in like a school class with yearband tbh
07/02/2022, 20:54 - Sienna Lam: And you had Chinese class, so Chinese A, B and Foreign
07/02/2022, 20:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, it wouldn't have any mechanical effect but it would establish who was close friends, which characters were which age etc
07/02/2022, 20:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ~probably shouldn't include race tho~
07/02/2022, 20:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It actually does matter in HK scouting imo but like, it's maybe not the kind of thing we want to reproduce just because of a dnd joke
07/02/2022, 20:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It would be cool if characters carried over between sessions but you could earn proficiency badges by doing relevant things. You could ratchet up the difficulty by introducing more annoyances and hazards, plus removing boons
07/02/2022, 20:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And only in the vaguest "all the white kids quit by year 11" sense
07/02/2022, 21:05 - Sienna Lam: All the gay kids quit by year 12
07/02/2022, 21:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: false
07/02/2022, 21:05 - Patsy Ng: very false
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What are some fun positive boons that could come with a campsite
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Imo, archery is the main one
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Sienna Lam: Barbecue
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Sienna Lam: Barbecue
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But maybe a fencing place and a pizza oven
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Sienna Lam: Barbeque
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeeeee
07/02/2022, 21:07 - Patsy Ng: campfire pit? but like. every camp should have one i think
07/02/2022, 21:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Depends, you wouldn't on a beach site
07/02/2022, 21:08 - Patsy Ng: what campsite have you been to that has a pizza oven

apart from the ones you have to make using green wood you harvest and stack over a barbeque pit yourself
07/02/2022, 21:08 - Patsy Ng: fair
07/02/2022, 21:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think the players would choose a trip and it would come with certain amenities, then the others would be randomised
07/02/2022, 21:08 - Patsy Ng: rope course
07/02/2022, 21:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: None but I think it would make for fun gameplay because people might try to use it for the forging of tools or sth
07/02/2022, 21:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hell yeah
07/02/2022, 21:09 - Patsy Ng: kayak shed?
07/02/2022, 21:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oooh yeah
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: a parade ground
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: not fun but maybe useful?
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe that would come with the beach site because a kayak shed might be odd on like a mountain trail
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sports field
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: yeah

but i guess a mountain trail could come with a bike shed
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ooh I believe it was Gilwell that came with a gutter system
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: yeah
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Patsy Ng: it kind of really needs one
07/02/2022, 21:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which could be used for sneaking, *or* if it rains you could use that to ward off witches
07/02/2022, 21:11 - Patsy Ng: i think at some gilwell camps there was leatherworking
07/02/2022, 21:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oooh
07/02/2022, 21:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe there could be an islands map where it spawns like, two mini campsites with different issues
07/02/2022, 21:15 - Sienna Lam: In one of the Kennedy school camps they had a gaming room
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ooh what if a CCTV room was a possibility
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Seems creepy but could be useful
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or alternatively
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A tower you could climb and use a telescope from
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Sienna Lam: Fnaf vibes
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Sienna Lam: watching the cereal killer stealing cereal
07/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That would be more scouty
07/02/2022, 21:17 - Patsy Ng: that's what the sentient stars are for
07/02/2022, 21:17 - Patsy Ng: ooooh remember that time a kid went missing at gilwell so they had helicopter sweeps going the whole night
07/02/2022, 21:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oooh
07/02/2022, 22:17 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
08/02/2022, 01:10 - Tara: <Media omitted>
08/02/2022, 01:10 - Sienna Lam: Women in stem cells
08/02/2022, 01:11 - Tara: Lofe
08/02/2022, 01:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
08/02/2022, 01:46 - Sienna Lam: Cuz Chinese like fresh food
08/02/2022, 07:21 - Patsy Ng: ok i asked bodybuilder tutor a question after the end of the tutorial bc i didn't get a question from the exercise sheet, and he was like "email me" so i did and we've sent like 7 emails today (all p short tho it's not like. entire essays' worth)

this guy isn't even my tutor he was essentially a sub

and the most recent email from him was sent at 21:45

they get off work at 17:00
08/02/2022, 07:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Is that good?
08/02/2022, 07:22 - Patsy Ng: it's good for me learning the content

i'm just. amazed by this guy's dedication
08/02/2022, 07:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: teachers love teaching i guess
08/02/2022, 07:23 - Patsy Ng: mm
08/02/2022, 07:23 - Damien Fung: dude i had a prof reply to an email at 2am before
08/02/2022, 07:23 - Damien Fung: it was so weird seeing a notif at 2am from a prof
08/02/2022, 07:24 - Patsy Ng: it's just. made me super intensely curious as to how any of them have the time

like. my actual tutor spent 39 mins (teams shows how much time has elapsed since the call began) with me on a teams call bc i didn't understand sth else last thursday (it was the one i had to run to)

and like. didn't they all have a massive strike in december bc they had too much work

and they have another one planned soon i think
08/02/2022, 07:25 - Patsy Ng: like i am One more cs-question away from straight up asking about how they have the time to do this
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh pat are they striking at your uni
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Patsy Ng: yeah
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Patsy Ng: not currently
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but soon, right?
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Patsy Ng: yeah
08/02/2022, 07:26 - Patsy Ng: if your uni is part of the ucu i think it has to strike if the ucu strikes
08/02/2022, 07:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah

09/02/2022, 14:36 - Damien Fung: oh yeah y'all have 1000 cases right?
09/02/2022, 14:36 - Sienna Lam: So that means you’re not coming for the 19th?
09/02/2022, 14:36 - Tara: I'm not
09/02/2022, 14:36 - Damien Fung: welcome to the squad
09/02/2022, 14:36 - Tara: They also reduced the hangout size from 4 to 2
09/02/2022, 14:36 - Sienna Lam: Let’s postpone this
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Sienna Lam: Pray covid ends
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Damien Fung: man covid ain't gonna end
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Tara: Dun dun dun
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Damien Fung: idk why hk's trying to do that zero covid thingy
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Damien Fung: it ain't gonna work
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Tara: Because they're stupid
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Damien Fung: yeah
09/02/2022, 14:37 - Tara: Incredibly inflexible
09/02/2022, 14:38 - Sienna Lam: Cuz all the old peoples are antivaxxers
09/02/2022, 14:38 - Tara: I guess they're looking out for the old people
09/02/2022, 14:38 - Tara: Yeah
09/02/2022, 14:38 - Damien Fung: before yesterday i was hoping it'd be the straw that broke the camel's back such that they'd decide to reduce or get rid of quarantine stuff but nah they just do a gigabrain strat and make it even stricter
09/02/2022, 14:39 - Sienna Lam: China has 90-something vaccination rate that’s why they’re not getting as much covid restrictions even though they’re also zero covid
09/02/2022, 14:41 - Sienna Lam: HK government should just mandate vaccinations tbh
09/02/2022, 14:59 - Merilyn Wong: because we have a massive aging population
09/02/2022, 14:59 - Merilyn Wong: o yea yall said that alr
09/02/2022, 15:00 - Merilyn Wong: man i rly wish

09/02/2022, 16:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No tbh it's a good thing, it's just annoying that nobody else is so covid keeps coming back
09/02/2022, 16:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If every country did it properly covid would be easy to contain, but because America and the UK don't wanna do shit and rich countries don't want to help poor ones everybody has to kinda deal with it
09/02/2022, 16:11 - Sienna Lam: it works for china HK isnt doing enough
09/02/2022, 16:11 - Sienna Lam: cuz my antigovernment sentiment lul
09/02/2022, 16:16 - Sienna Lam: im dumb i took 2 school sponsored courses which is redundant
09/02/2022, 16:18 - Damien Fung: yeah but at this rate with the rest of the world being so far gone there's no point in trying to contain it anymore
09/02/2022, 16:18 - Merilyn Wong: 💀💀💀💀
09/02/2022, 16:18 - Damien Fung: like even with all the effort over the past 2 years hk's still following the same trends as other countries but just with a delay of about a month
09/02/2022, 16:19 - Merilyn Wong: Hey we were p good for most of 2021 tbf
09/02/2022, 16:19 - Merilyn Wong: Its just this stupid variant

09/02/2022, 16:31 - Damien Fung: there's like 3 platforms and instead of rows of seats you get full on tables
09/02/2022, 16:31 - Damien Fung: and bc that might stop some people from seeing the board there's like a million screens on the walls so that no matter where you sit you can see the board

09/02/2022, 17:09 - Damien Fung: tbh it's not that complicated
09/02/2022, 17:09 - Sienna Lam: i was like 12 lol
09/02/2022, 17:09 - Damien Fung: it's just that java's usually the bridge between intro and intermediate programming
09/02/2022, 17:12 - Sienna Lam: if i press the spacebar and im not on zoom does it open the mic
09/02/2022, 17:12 - Sienna Lam: like if zoom is in the background
09/02/2022, 17:12 - Damien Fung: don't think so but there's a setting to turn that off completely

09/02/2022, 17:29 - Sienna Lam: wait python has its own compiler? why did i install pycharm then
09/02/2022, 17:30 - Damien Fung: so you can see what you're doing???
09/02/2022, 17:30 - Tara: damien chill sienna isn't a programmer
09/02/2022, 17:30 - Damien Fung: a lot of features that make life a lot easier in programming are there in IDEs and not running your code in terminal
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: this is true
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Sienna Lam: They don’t let me use PU charm
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Sienna Lam: in the COMP thing
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Tara: you should use vscode
i like it better
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: do you get to use an IDE at least?
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Sienna Lam: they want me to use idle which is the thing that comes with python
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: ^
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Tara: you dont have to listen to them
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: c u r s e d
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Tara: use pycharm
09/02/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: who uses idle in this day and age
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: ^^^^^
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Tara: sid and i used an ide
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Sienna Lam: I’ll just copy and paste it from pycharm into idle
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Tara: if you need help debugging pycharm then ask us
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: yeah it does the same thing
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Tara: because they probably wont help
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Sienna Lam: Thanks
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Tara: with pycharm
09/02/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: ik how to use the pycharm debugger too so feel free to ask for help from me too

09/02/2022, 17:34 - Tara: oui oui
09/02/2022, 18:05 - Merilyn Wong: Wow the clouds have actual silver linings rn
09/02/2022, 18:06 - Merilyn Wong: 
09/02/2022, 18:06 - Sienna Lam: Seems more like gold to me
09/02/2022, 18:06 - Merilyn Wong: Even betterr
09/02/2022, 18:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: MTRdle: you guess a station and it tells you how many stops away it is from the actual answer
09/02/2022, 18:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Would code it but I cba
09/02/2022, 19:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: antivaxxers are always really annoying but now they're doing some weird hiv conspiracy theory shit so I actively hate them even more
09/02/2022, 19:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: some MP in the UK posted a picture getting tested like "Anyone can get HIV and there's no shame in getting tested for it, here's how:" and all the replies and qts are flooded with weird antivaxxers going "umm actually only gay people get HIV, why would you want to get tested? if anybody else gets it it's the vaccine"
09/02/2022, 19:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and like
09/02/2022, 19:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: fuck, man, fuck off
09/02/2022, 19:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I get tested every three months for a whole suite of things, whether I've had anal sex or not, as is normal in the community, but I have literally no idea what straight people are and aren't getting tested for
09/02/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This comes with the news that the majority of people with HIV in Current Year are heterosexual, too
09/02/2022, 19:50 - Merilyn Wong: ://// that sucks dude sorry
09/02/2022, 19:51 - Merilyn Wong: This virus is rly bringing out the worst in everybody
09/02/2022, 19:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Btw y'all should too if testing is accessible where you are, whether you are sexually active or not. At least once, anyway
09/02/2022, 19:52 - Merilyn Wong: Like sexually active once or get tested once
09/02/2022, 19:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: both I guess
09/02/2022, 19:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: can't hurt
09/02/2022, 19:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You're unlikely to find anything but it's nice to always know
09/02/2022, 20:03 - Patsy Ng: isn't pride month in june

that's ages away
09/02/2022, 20:04 - Patsy Ng: hhhh
09/02/2022, 20:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: is there a graph theory algo that could find the closest path between MTR stations?
09/02/2022, 20:08 - Patsy Ng: yeah isn't it. dikijstra's or sth
09/02/2022, 20:08 - Patsy Ng: I can't spell it
09/02/2022, 20:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

oooh looks good
09/02/2022, 20:08 - Patsy Ng: bc the stations are nodes and the lines are a series. of edges
09/02/2022, 20:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So, MTRdle would probably tell you:

- distance
- whether you got the right line?
09/02/2022, 20:09 - Patsy Ng: you remember this from ib maths right
09/02/2022, 20:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: bold of you to assume I remember anything we studied in the IB

09/02/2022, 20:55 - Patsy Ng: doing the group report for that group project I mentioned and the one perk of being the person that does everything is I started the report so I get to pick the formatting and I'm making them compose it in comic sans

(will change before we submit but comic sans makes it easier for some reason)
09/02/2022, 20:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because comic sans means you're less intimidated
09/02/2022, 20:55 - Patsy Ng: yeah
09/02/2022, 20:56 - Patsy Ng: but I think. I genuinely started liking using it for drafts in the like. last four years
09/02/2022, 20:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
09/02/2022, 21:05 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
09/02/2022, 22:50 - Patsy Ng: i really want to send a snip of the group compsci report here so i can make you all commiserate with me about the quality of the one teammate who's actually doing work's writing

they are not using full sentences, everything is in a block, and there are aren't any connectives between different statements
09/02/2022, 22:52 - Patsy Ng: but yeah. i want you all to know that i am cringing as hard as i did when that horribly-written 21clhk article went up with my name attached when i'd done none of the awful, awful work
09/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: So Dulwich was inaugurated by an English price

10/02/2022, 18:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I thought you already hit your goal?
10/02/2022, 18:22 - Merilyn Wong: Omg yes
10/02/2022, 18:24 - Merilyn Wong: Did anyone hear abt the russian figure skating thing this morning
10/02/2022, 18:24 - Sienna Lam: ye so sad
10/02/2022, 18:24 - Tara: What happened
10/02/2022, 18:24 - Sienna Lam: tired of 'integrity' in sports its just used to be russophobic/transphobic
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Merilyn Wong: Its a whole huge thing may i call u
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Tara: Eh I'm watching modern family sorry
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Tara: Is there an article
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Tara: Apologies
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Merilyn Wong: Ah i completely understand
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Sienna Lam: some russian kid was doping apparently
10/02/2022, 18:25 - Merilyn Wong: I will dm u some posts and someones ig account
10/02/2022, 18:26 - Merilyn Wong: *****some russian coach forced a minor to take performance enhancing drugs and has probably been doing it for years and still got away with it
10/02/2022, 18:26 - Sienna Lam: They just make stuff up about Russia tbh
10/02/2022, 18:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It looks like it was drugs with actual medical utility tho
10/02/2022, 18:27 - Merilyn Wong: Coach eteri is properly bad tho, there are receipts
10/02/2022, 18:27 - Sienna Lam: I lost my trust in BS sports integrity when they kicked out a cis woman for having too much testosterone
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's unclear whether it's doping, it could be a situation like
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Sienna Lam: And it wasn’t even like she was injecting it, she just had naturally high testosterone
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Simone Biles having to get off ADHD meds
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Sienna Lam: ^
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Caster Semenya yeah
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Merilyn Wong: Honestly the olympics is a big huge mess, im not even watching for the sports, just the tea
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They legit wanted to make her do hormone blocking
10/02/2022, 18:28 - Sienna Lam: They don’t care about actual sports integrity or they wouldn’t let athletes drink coffee before the sports. T
10/02/2022, 18:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Tbh the "russian Olympic committee" thing is really funny, because like, they're supposed to be banned but they just mildly changed their name
10/02/2022, 18:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Especially when they chose "ROC" while Taiwan still has to go by Chinese Taipei
10/02/2022, 18:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: When officially Taiwan's called the ROC lol
10/02/2022, 18:30 - Merilyn Wong: They came back wearing a fake moustache and sunglasses
10/02/2022, 18:30 - Sienna Lam: If there was a guy who didn’t produce lactic acid (ther is a guy like that) then he should be banned from competing by the international sports logic
10/02/2022, 18:31 - Merilyn Wong: Ye if ur have coronary artery disease lmao
10/02/2022, 18:31 - Sienna Lam: Should a trans man be banned from sports he usually has way more testosterone than a cis man
10/02/2022, 18:32 - Sienna Lam: how do u know some kids get disease very early.
10/02/2022, 18:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or vertigo I read
10/02/2022, 18:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Obviously a figure skater probably would not have vertigo tho
10/02/2022, 18:32 - Sienna Lam: They just looking for a reason to kick out people they don’t like
10/02/2022, 18:32 - Merilyn Wong: Ye plausible but its been used as a performance enhancer in the past
10/02/2022, 18:33 - Sienna Lam: Should a trans man not be allowed to compete with other men when he is taking extra testosterone
10/02/2022, 18:33 - Sienna Lam: That is a performance enhancer so should also be not allowed to take
10/02/2022, 18:33 - Merilyn Wong: Sorry i dont know enough about testosterones medical uses yet
10/02/2022, 18:34 - Merilyn Wong: But i learned about this drug so when i saw it in the news i did the leo dicaprio meme point
10/02/2022, 18:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Hhhh
10/02/2022, 18:35 - Merilyn Wong: Honestly that could totally be it
10/02/2022, 18:35 - Merilyn Wong: They just dredged up this drug test from dec 2021 all of a sudden right before the medal ceremony
10/02/2022, 18:36 - Sienna Lam: Weren’t there these Chinese athletes who took Chinese medicine and then it was ‘supposedly’ performance enhancing drug last time
10/02/2022, 18:37 - Merilyn Wong: The specific drug kamila was taking was banned by the anti doping agency tho
10/02/2022, 18:37 - Sienna Lam: If I care about what ‘anti doping agency’ says they should prove that they’re unbiased first
10/02/2022, 18:38 - Sienna Lam: And not kicking out intersex and trans ppl for no reason
10/02/2022, 18:38 - Sienna Lam: more like ‘pro America, pro cishet, anti-female
10/02/2022, 18:38 - Merilyn Wong: :(
10/02/2022, 18:39 - Merilyn Wong: Ye nathan chen getting gold is heartbreaking
10/02/2022, 18:39 - Sienna Lam: I not even care about the specific case tbh I just hate the idea of ‘anti doping’
10/02/2022, 18:40 - Merilyn Wong: Ah i see
10/02/2022, 18:41 - Sienna Lam: They even stopped this disabled runner from competing with non disabled runners cuz ‘his artificial legs gave him an advantage’
10/02/2022, 18:42 - Merilyn Wong: Reminds me of that nice post where a guy getting prosthetic legs wanted to be taller so they just. made him taller
10/02/2022, 18:42 - Merilyn Wong: Love that for him
10/02/2022, 18:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Tbh I'm not really invested in the doping convo because iirc the rules they use to exclude trans people are already different to the rules they use on cis doping
10/02/2022, 18:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In other news, Eileen Gu 😍

no hetero
10/02/2022, 18:44 - Merilyn Wong: O damn rly
10/02/2022, 18:44 - Merilyn Wong: 💕💕💕 legend
10/02/2022, 18:44 - Sienna Lam: It’s the same principle though, that they want to keep the ‘integrity’ of sports
10/02/2022, 18:44 - Sienna Lam: if it’s such a problem get rid of competitive sports and do cooperative sports
10/02/2022, 18:45 - Sienna Lam: Like team sports
10/02/2022, 18:45 - Sienna Lam: like dragon boat
10/02/2022, 18:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: American media has been so weird about her

10/02/2022, 18:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hollering at the depiction of xi jinping wielding the Olympic rings as if he were Shang Chi
10/02/2022, 18:47 - Merilyn Wong: Bruh
10/02/2022, 18:47 - Merilyn Wong: Neat
10/02/2022, 18:48 - Sienna Lam: Shang Xi
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can't remember which outlet it was that was like "it's possible that her coach lured her over to the Chinese side with this Chinese thing called Guanxi"
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And like
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ... you mean by being her friend?
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "Guanxi" literally just means "knowing a guy" lmao
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Merilyn Wong: Like 關係 like.....relationship?
10/02/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah lmao
10/02/2022, 18:50 - Merilyn Wong: Ahahahaha
10/02/2022, 18:50 - Sienna Lam: muricans think it means corruption for some reason
10/02/2022, 18:50 - Sienna Lam: when its just being friends with people
10/02/2022, 18:50 - Sienna Lam: i.e. networking

10/02/2022, 18:52 - Merilyn Wong: Omg chinese voodoo what do u think it is
10/02/2022, 18:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk but it has an X in it so it must be spooky
10/02/2022, 18:53 - Merilyn Wong: Do u think its like that lady from the magic village in shangchi
10/02/2022, 18:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The villain in Shang Chi 2 should wield the mystical power of guanxi
10/02/2022, 18:53 - Merilyn Wong: The real treasure was guanxi all along

11/02/2022, 02:21 - Patsy Ng: this video had a much calmer tone than the last few
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: wow you went really close to the swans
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Patsy Ng: yeet
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah this one was my attempt to make one that I wasn't like
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Cindy Yang: swans?
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: eating myself alive to create
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Cindy Yang: i see
11/02/2022, 02:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: pat posted a video of swans at some point
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Cindy Yang: yea it's got chiller vibes
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Patsy Ng: if you're watching the stream dovtor is me
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Cindy Yang: o ya
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i did it in like three days and didn't stay up or anything
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Patsy Ng: how did that work
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Cindy Yang: o i didn't realize y'all were in the chat
11/02/2022, 02:22 - Patsy Ng: like how did you manage to drastically change it
11/02/2022, 02:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: a lot of it is the music but also idk I think I have more chill as a person now
11/02/2022, 02:23 - Cindy Yang: nice
11/02/2022, 02:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and I wasn't covering such a heavy topic
11/02/2022, 02:23 - Patsy Ng: oh I thought you were intentionally staying off to remain anonymous/untraceable on youtube
11/02/2022, 02:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the goal wasn't to illustrate the entire crime and punishment and journalism systems in turn of the century new york or contextualise the entire james bond franchise in terms of an old book by this one scholar
11/02/2022, 02:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it was to like
11/02/2022, 02:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk have a chill time talking about time
11/02/2022, 02:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i did sneak in some snipes at the nhs and at steven pinker (fuck steven pinker) but other than that good vibes
11/02/2022, 02:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: also I think the fact that I narrated it through voice over and used pictures of chill things meant I didn't have to cut as many edits together which makes it feel more smooth
11/02/2022, 02:25 - Cindy Yang: ah partially but i also didn’t realize y’all were there lol
11/02/2022, 02:25 - Cindy Yang: funky

11/02/2022, 02:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: my name will simply have to be Known
11/02/2022, 02:33 - Patsy Ng: oh huh I thought you were gonna try not to be the uni spokesperson

11/02/2022, 02:41 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
11/02/2022, 02:42 - Cindy Yang: am wondering about the prevalence of expressions that start with ‘ai’

11/02/2022, 02:55 - Cindy Yang: and i was like ya i feel like if it was the mexican flag it'd have the thing in the middle
11/02/2022, 02:56 - Cindy Yang: and we were like oh but maybe you have to turn it on the side? what flag would that be
11/02/2022, 02:56 - Cindy Yang: and then we looked at the label to check and it said 'christmas pattern'
11/02/2022, 02:57 - Patsy Ng: your saying "the bf" has the same vibes as mr welsh saying "the wife"
11/02/2022, 02:58 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
11/02/2022, 02:58 - Cindy Yang: no but mr welsh called her she-who-must-not-be-named right
11/02/2022, 02:58 - Cindy Yang: or something like that
11/02/2022, 02:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: pride flag

11/02/2022, 13:24 - Tara: hey dont generalise
11/02/2022, 13:24 - Tanushree Banerjee: Also does that make him an asshole?

11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tara: tell him you dont like him
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Sienna Lam: i know what it is like to be male so i know it is so weird lul
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Anyway Farah was generally angry w him
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tara: and to literally _stop_
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: I told Hadley I don’t
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: She must have relayed
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Sienna Lam: why would she relay?
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: They are dating
11/02/2022, 13:25 - Tanushree Banerjee: Lol
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Sienna Lam: then she wouldnt, because why would she tell him stuff about other girls
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tara: a sense of security>
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: Idk he acted normal w me for the first time
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: In months
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Sienna Lam: just tell him off cuz hes dumb
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: But that was for 2 secs
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Sienna Lam: or tell him ur a lesbian
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tara: no
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Tanushree Banerjee: …
11/02/2022, 13:26 - Sienna Lam: just to get him ooff your back
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tara: why would you lie about your identity
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tara: just for someone else
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: No but
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Sienna Lam: remember the good place, this dude told eleanor he was gay to get out of dating her
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tara: yeah he's an asshole
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: I’m just so confused why he’d obsess over me liking him
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tara: just be upfront
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: Like Farah emphasized he obsessed over it
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Sienna Lam: bitchslap him
11/02/2022, 13:27 - Tanushree Banerjee: I’m just confused what that means
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: Like he must care for me as a friend at some level?
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Sienna Lam: no?
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tara: so violent lah
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: Why no
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: But now
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Sienna Lam: is he already your friend?
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: The man barely talks to me
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Sienna Lam: if not then why would he care for you as a friend?
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: Yes boss
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tara: ah yes overcorrection hahahaha
11/02/2022, 13:28 - Tanushree Banerjee: I used to be one of his closest friends
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Sienna Lam: clearly he isnt a good friend
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: Now we barely talk
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Tara: when people like someone but are in denial they go out of their way to be like
weird
towards them
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: It’s weird
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: ?
11/02/2022, 13:29 - Tanushree Banerjee: Explain
11/02/2022, 13:31 - Sienna Lam: they feel its awkward to be around the person they like
11/02/2022, 14:54 - Tara: @85260220562 thanks for waking me because i forgot to record my studying
11/02/2022, 14:55 - Merilyn Wong: npnp

11/02/2022, 14:58 - Damien Fung: and was like shittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
11/02/2022, 14:58 - Damien Fung: then i checked the breakdown of what i got wrong
11/02/2022, 14:58 - Damien Fung: turns out
11/02/2022, 14:59 - Damien Fung: only 50% of the paper was graded
11/02/2022, 14:59 - Damien Fung: so rn i'm doin more than fine
11/02/2022, 14:59 - Tara: oh thank god
11/02/2022, 15:01 - Merilyn Wong: phewww
11/02/2022, 15:46 - Sienna Lam: canvas deleted all my oscean science notes
11/02/2022, 16:07 - Sienna Lam: that means u got 100%
11/02/2022, 16:17 - Merilyn Wong: Oo a wis graduate designed the typeface on mitski's new album
11/02/2022, 16:17 - Merilyn Wong: Font? Typeface? Idk which word is right
11/02/2022, 16:23 - Patsy Ng: funky
11/02/2022, 16:23 - Tara: HK 50AM is playing avril lavigne
11/02/2022, 16:24 - Tara: 80*
11/02/2022, 16:24 - Patsy Ng: hmm did the hk100 happen this year
11/02/2022, 16:26 - Tara: 800**
11/02/2022, 17:02 - Sienna Lam: does eileen gu count as a mainlander or is she an american
11/02/2022, 17:26 - Sienna Lam: why does python store numbers as string when using input function
11/02/2022, 17:26 - Sienna Lam: cant it tell the differnecey between numbers
11/02/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh I can legit do this
11/02/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I will fight your bf
11/02/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Random battle tho idk how to build for gen 8
11/02/2022, 17:27 - Sienna Lam: just pick arceus since hes literally god /s
11/02/2022, 17:29 - Sienna Lam: mongolia = input("Which Country are you from?")
if mongolia == "mongolia"
    print("You are cool")
else
    print("You are not cool")
11/02/2022, 17:29 - Sienna Lam: why doesnt this work?
11/02/2022, 17:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Did you forget a colon
11/02/2022, 17:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think if statements in Python require colons iirc
11/02/2022, 17:30 - Sienna Lam: o yea teacher istn doing if yet so he not using colon
11/02/2022, 17:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It stores all input as strings
11/02/2022, 17:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because all input is strings
11/02/2022, 17:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just int() it if necessary
11/02/2022, 17:31 - Sienna Lam: yeee it works
11/02/2022, 17:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What if sb is using a number string with zeroes in front
11/02/2022, 17:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Then if it converted to a number it would be broken
11/02/2022, 17:32 - Sienna Lam: is ther ea way to make each letter in the word a value?
11/02/2022, 17:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Treat the string like a list?
11/02/2022, 17:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
11/02/2022, 17:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: To get letter 1 do mongolia[0]
11/02/2022, 17:34 - Tara: if you want to input an integer write int(input(...
11/02/2022, 17:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or to iterate through

for char in mongolia:
    print(char)
11/02/2022, 17:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But also be aware that if people input anything else you may get an error
11/02/2022, 17:35 - Tara: yes true
11/02/2022, 17:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Code in wy-lang.org instead
11/02/2022, 17:37 - Tara: no code in lojban instead
11/02/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lojban is for speaking
11/02/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Code in brainfuck
11/02/2022, 17:37 - Tara: ah yes that
11/02/2022, 17:39 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/02/2022, 17:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: mood
11/02/2022, 17:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Anyway char I'm down to play Pokémon showdown with your bf, mainly because I think watching a gc showdown tourney would be funny
11/02/2022, 17:41 - Merilyn Wong: Dont think so
11/02/2022, 17:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: still, randoms pls unless he's really into gen 6 uu, since that's what I was into when I was ten years old and knew what was trendy
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Tara: hello so my friend is using this app
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Tara: and it's like pretty cool i think
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Tara: for studying
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So used to people using "sis" as what is essentially a pronoun that when somebody uses it to mean sister I get confused
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Tara: https://app.mystudylife.com/tasks
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Sienna Lam: big cis
11/02/2022, 17:45 - Merilyn Wong: Oooooo
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: im gonna be so efficient this sem
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: and @447380604852 you should join our YPT room
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: again, for studyin
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: g
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: but it's a korean app
11/02/2022, 17:46 - Tara: in case you're interested
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, ppl will legit be like "sis did this" and so on and so on, so I just read a post where somebody replied with "sis did []" and I was internally like "how do you know that about OP?"
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Tara: that's why you just refer to them as Sister or Sibling
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Merilyn Wong: O :( doesnt rly suit my schedule but the ui is rly nice
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm committed to using Forest for the time being tho
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Tara: which juvenile Child uses sis
11/02/2022, 17:47 - Tara: hhh how variable is it
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I like pretty trees
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Merilyn Wong: Esp w covid
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Merilyn Wong: They decided to have us do all the prerecorded sets in one go
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Merilyn Wong: And then do all the practical stuff in one go later when its safer
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Sienna Lam: is there an easier way to do this code?
11/02/2022, 17:48 - Sienna Lam: country = input("Which Country are you from?")
country_rating = (country.count("a")+(2*country.count("b"))+(4*country.count("c"))+(8*country.count("d"))+(16*country.count("e"))+(32*country.count("f"))+(64*country.count("g"))+(128*country.count("h"))+(256*country.count("i"))+(512*country.count("j"))+(1024*country.count("k"))+(2048*country.count("l"))+(4096*country.count("m"))+(8192*country.count("n"))+(2^14*country.count("o"))+(2^15*country.count("p"))+(2^16*country.count("p"))) % 10
country_rating = str(country_rating)
print("Your country basedness rating is " + country_rating)
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Tara: oh god
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Tara: what do you want to do with the string
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Tara: ok so a couple of things
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Sienna Lam: so it counts the number of each letter and multiplies it with 2^(the letters position in the alphabet)
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Tara: there's no ^
it's **
so 2**3 is the same as 2^3
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Tara: o
11/02/2022, 17:49 - Sienna Lam: thanks
11/02/2022, 17:50 - Tara: what if
11/02/2022, 17:50 - Tara: ok im gonna finish these slides and come back
11/02/2022, 17:50 - Tara: im thinking of strings and lists atm
11/02/2022, 17:51 - Sienna Lam: i dont wanna have to type it for every letter
11/02/2022, 17:51 - Sienna Lam: also to make it mod 10
11/02/2022, 17:51 - Sienna Lam: so it goes from 1 to 10
11/02/2022, 17:51 - Tara: what if you have a list of all characters
11/02/2022, 17:51 - Sienna Lam: i forgot how to make a list in ython
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Tara: alpha = ['a', 'b', ... ]
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Tara: then use those indexes
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Tara: yessss ok so
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Tara: i have an idea
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Tara: let me write it out
11/02/2022, 17:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would:

Make a dictionary which assigned each letter a number

Then

total = 0
for char in country:
    total += points[char]
print("Your country's basedness =" + str(total))
11/02/2022, 17:53 - Tara: how bout just a list
11/02/2022, 17:53 - Tara: and use the indexes
11/02/2022, 17:53 - Sienna Lam: whats a dictionary
11/02/2022, 17:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bc I don't remember the easiest way to search a list
11/02/2022, 17:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A dictionary is like
11/02/2022, 17:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A list where you search by key instead of index
11/02/2022, 17:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
11/02/2022, 17:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: colours = {
"red" : "FF0000"
"white":"FFFFFF"
}
11/02/2022, 17:55 - Tara: ohhhh
11/02/2022, 17:55 - Tara: so i found a better way
11/02/2022, 17:55 - Tara: using ascii
11/02/2022, 17:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's like a list where you can use one value to get another
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Tara: you dont need to use dictionaries / lists
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh yeah that's really good
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Convert to ASCII and then subtract one number each time
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Since the letters are in order
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Tara: it's letter - 'a' + 1
11/02/2022, 17:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Genius
11/02/2022, 17:57 - Tara: wait
11/02/2022, 17:57 - Tara: lmao that's not python i think
11/02/2022, 17:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
11/02/2022, 17:59 - Sienna Lam: country = input ("What is your country?")

11/02/2022, 17:59 - Sienna Lam: its not working
11/02/2022, 17:59 - Tara: oh no
11/02/2022, 17:59 - Sienna Lam: oh
11/02/2022, 18:00 - Sienna Lam: it works if i use lower case
11/02/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just do the power shit after you get the value and do "a": 1 and so on
11/02/2022, 18:00 - Tara: gimem a country
11/02/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah you want to convert your input to lower case before you do anything
11/02/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because it's not case sensitive and that makes it easier
11/02/2022, 18:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You also need to detect "Japan" and give a value of 0
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Sienna Lam: it works now
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In fact, j a p & n should give negative points
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Tara: Sienna
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Tara: country
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Tara: which one
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: japan
11/02/2022, 18:02 - Tara: 8
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: sienna what did you get
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Sienna Lam: 4
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: oh no
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: ohh
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: you put a as 0
11/02/2022, 18:03 - Tara: yep 4
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Tara: import string

country = input("Which country are you from? ")

    total += pow(2, string.ascii_lowercase.index(char))

print(total % 10)
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Sienna Lam: <Media omitted>
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Tara: pow(2, n) is the same as 2**n which is the same as 2^n
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Sienna Lam: thanks
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Patsy Ng: I guess you could get each char separately, then convert to int? can't remember if char-int conversion is a thing python does
11/02/2022, 18:04 - Tara: string.asci_.... just gives you the index of the character
11/02/2022, 18:05 - Tara: country = country.lower() turns it into a lower case form
11/02/2022, 18:05 - Patsy Ng: nooo don't that makes your program crash if a non-int gets put in and you don't wrap it in a try-catch
11/02/2022, 18:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
11/02/2022, 18:06 - Tara: so write var = input (...)
then var = int(var)?

What is your country?usa
Your country's basedness is 1 out of 10
11/02/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Based but how
11/02/2022, 18:07 - Patsy Ng: have dictionary somewhere else mapping values to characters

then just iterate through the string to add each character's value up
11/02/2022, 18:07 - Sienna Lam: luck
11/02/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: U is a big number

11/02/2022, 18:19 - Patsy Ng: anyway that module is run by two lecturers 

the striking guy does mondays and wednesdays, the other guy does thursdays and fridays (he's not striking bc he's director of teaching, which would throw the entire school out of whack (which i thought was the point of striking, but his call i guess))

so the non-striking guy was giving his lecture just now and then at the end the striking guy turned his camera on and revealed he's been lurking the entire time and non-striking guy was like "oh god you've been listening to me ramble on this whole time why would you do that" and in the smallest voice striking guy goes "it's just nice to hear people's voices sometimes, when you're at home"

striking guy also lives ten miles from st andrews and also apparently records his lectures sitting cross-legged on his study floor so. yeah i hope he's ok

12/02/2022, 16:24 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah forgot to mention but my flatmate has covid

her nickname's blue so when we were getting her snacks we exclusively bought blue snacks and we nearly cleared the store of blue smartie Easter eggs, but that wasn't hard considering there were only like ten of them
12/02/2022, 16:28 - Tara: Wowza
12/02/2022, 16:28 - Tara: Is she ok
12/02/2022, 16:28 - Tara: And what other snacks did you buy
12/02/2022, 16:30 - Patsy Ng: yeah apparently symptomless

but that might have changed since
12/02/2022, 16:31 - Patsy Ng: instant noodles

also a chocolate bunny but we dropped it while packing and the foil ripped so we just omitted it and then smashed it apart in the kitchen and ate it with our hands while texting another flatmate to "come get rabbit meat"
12/02/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: lol nice
12/02/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: also what time are we meeting char's bf again?

12/02/2022, 20:13 - Patsy Ng: but you can't ever know

12/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: its hard ot talk to men generally is what i mean
12/02/2022, 20:53 - Sienna Lam: you could even say hard to talk to people
12/02/2022, 20:54 - Sienna Lam: but yea just easier to talk to people who share commonalities with you
12/02/2022, 20:58 - Patsy Ng: hmm fair

but i feel like. you're looking at people and just seeing whether they're cis/het and then that's it. a really surface level impression of people
12/02/2022, 20:59 - Sienna Lam: i have a list of commonalities in my head
12/02/2022, 20:59 - Tara: Remember the meme of people moving the goalposts

-not into weird stuff 
-plays computer games
-asian?
-lgbt
-female

12/02/2022, 21:05 - Tara: Oh and I get them to talk about themselves
Like where they're from family major etc
12/02/2022, 21:05 - Patsy Ng: you don't have to talk? I have a friend here and we mostly jsut sit in silence until someone thinks of something weird like "why are grey shirts never solid grey" and then we discuss it for the like. next 20 mins
12/02/2022, 21:05 - Tara: And their sibling's majors
12/02/2022, 21:05 - Patsy Ng: do share
12/02/2022, 21:05 - Tara: So we can talk about the merits of being the younger sibling
12/02/2022, 21:05 - Patsy Ng: this is four things
12/02/2022, 21:06 - Cindy Yang: if the convo gets awkward today at least we can move to skribbl lol

12/02/2022, 21:09 - Tara: From Tumblr
12/02/2022, 21:09 - Tara: Hahahaha
12/02/2022, 21:10 - Merilyn Wong: O ok

So he goes to the british army like hey i wanna help u fight fascists
12/02/2022, 21:10 - Tara: What's solid grey
12/02/2022, 21:10 - Merilyn Wong: And theyre like no
12/02/2022, 21:11 - Merilyn Wong: So he goes to the nazis and hes like hey i wanna spy on the british for u and theyre like hmm sounds legit u got the gig kid
12/02/2022, 21:11 - Tara: I'm glad I'm friends with people who tell stories well because I seem to be terrible at it
12/02/2022, 21:12 - Merilyn Wong: And then he goes back to the british and hes like hey im working for the nazis but i wanna spy for u

British are like uhhh still no
12/02/2022, 21:14 - Merilyn Wong: So then he goes home to lisbon and sets up his own sorta operation where the nazis think hes in london and he feeds them random bs that he reads from like tourist brochures

O u know uhhh scots like wine

Good good this is good shit
12/02/2022, 21:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk I think they're more into whisky
12/02/2022, 21:14 - Patsy Ng: owner as in the dog that owned the ball or the human who owned the dog that owned the ball
12/02/2022, 21:14 - Tara: Chile

12/02/2022, 21:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: my aunt does like rosé tho
12/02/2022, 21:15 - Patsy Ng: like you know how white t shirts ar ejust white

there s not just grey shirt
12/02/2022, 21:15 - Cindy Yang: that would be a smart dog
12/02/2022, 21:15 - Tara: Martin we're meeting at 10 btw in case you forgot
12/02/2022, 21:16 - Merilyn Wong: Then he makes it more elaborate and hes like got "agents" that he sends to gather "intel" for him and at this pounts the nazis love him like this is the best damn agent weve ever had

Cos like any other spies they sent into london always got caught
12/02/2022, 21:16 - Tara: Sorry I don't understand
Like it's not purely grey?
12/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like a grey that's not patterned
12/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Grey shirts often have
12/02/2022, 21:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk grain?
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Tara: Ohh I see what you mean
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Tara: Ok thanks
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh also I have a question
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: do you know any geographers
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Merilyn Wong: So the nazis had the enigma code right so after the brits crack the enigma then they intercept all these messages abt this amazing spy and then they go hang on we know that guy, he came to us like twice
12/02/2022, 21:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i have a research issue but my geographer friend doesn't know
12/02/2022, 21:19 - Merilyn Wong: So now they contact him like hey we heard abt what ur doing and we wanna help u

Then the lil operation gets super elaborate cos now he gets to feed the nazis real intel, but timed so that by the time they receive it its useless

Stuff like ship locations etc.
12/02/2022, 21:19 - Cindy Yang: :0 damn
12/02/2022, 21:19 - Merilyn Wong: So now the nazis love him even more
12/02/2022, 21:22 - Merilyn Wong: And then they do this for a while and then comes d-day

So he feeds the nazis fake intel abt where the british are gonna be coming in
12/02/2022, 21:23 - Merilyn Wong: And then they send the fake inflatable tanks to that side but they go to normandy instead
12/02/2022, 21:23 - Sienna Lam: ye they were gona go for calais first but didnt cuz it was obvious
12/02/2022, 21:24 - Merilyn Wong: And at the end of it he gets medals from both sides
12/02/2022, 21:24 - Sienna Lam: also normandy is where the british came from interestingly
12/02/2022, 21:25 - Merilyn Wong: And then after the war theyre like hey u wanna go spy in russia for us

And hes like nah actually can u just help me fake my death and i'll go home and drink wine
12/02/2022, 21:25 - Merilyn Wong: And thats what he did
12/02/2022, 21:25 - Merilyn Wong: And then he published an autobiography
12/02/2022, 21:26 - Cindy Yang: dope
12/02/2022, 21:26 - Merilyn Wong: They were gonna make a movie starring oscar isaac but idk whats happening to that now

12/02/2022, 21:45 - Cindy Yang: damn
12/02/2022, 21:47 - Patsy Ng: idk I thought there might have been some personification going on
12/02/2022, 21:47 - Tara: yahas turns out im not shit at physics
12/02/2022, 21:47 - Tara: good job me

12/02/2022, 21:48 - Tara: ooh
12/02/2022, 21:48 - Tara: interesting
12/02/2022, 21:48 - Cindy Yang: :0
12/02/2022, 21:49 - Patsy Ng: off the top of my head just long away, also by queen
12/02/2022, 21:49 - Tara: <Media omitted>
12/02/2022, 21:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: can you ask them if they know where one might find
12/02/2022, 21:50 - Tara: tyt
12/02/2022, 21:50 - Tara: y
12/02/2022, 21:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: estimates of the volume of water contained in the Nile river
12/02/2022, 21:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Preferably a bunch of them for different years and seasons
12/02/2022, 21:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: not the rate of flow, the volume
12/02/2022, 21:53 - Patsy Ng: i can try but idk when i'll see them again?
12/02/2022, 21:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's no rush
12/02/2022, 21:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: do you not have their contact details?
12/02/2022, 21:53 - Patsy Ng: i do but i hate facebook
12/02/2022, 21:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: big moo
12/02/2022, 21:55 - Cindy Yang: 🐄
12/02/2022, 21:55 - Tara: oh lawd i will be a tiny bit late
12/02/2022, 21:55 - Tara: i have two questions left
12/02/2022, 21:55 - Tara: three questions*
12/02/2022, 21:55 - Patsy Ng: wait couldn't you calculate it from the flow
12/02/2022, 21:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: how
12/02/2022, 21:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I believe I tried and realised it was infeasible because I was missing a specific variable
12/02/2022, 21:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but like
12/02/2022, 21:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: two rivers of different lengths can easily have the same rate of flow
12/02/2022, 21:57 - Cindy Yang: no prob
12/02/2022, 21:58 - Tara: nvm am done
12/02/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: ok 

long away by queen, it's about. dealing with grief i guess

golden lights by the smiths, it's kind of about longing for a time that has passed and knowing it won't come back i guess. also it's like. 1987 so similar era to queen

in the light by the lumineers, just has the same vibe

time in a bottle by jim croce, kind of a far reach but give it a shot

precious memories by sister rosetta thorpe, it just also has that rainy day curl up with a book and a cup of tea vibe
12/02/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: yeah i realized
12/02/2022, 21:59 - Tara: thank you i will listen to these after the call
12/02/2022, 22:00 - Cindy Yang: aight how r we doing tbe call
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Tara: oh yeah he's not on the server
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: discord I assume?
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Cindy Yang: yeet
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Cindy Yang: how did we do it last time lol
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Tara: discord
12/02/2022, 22:01 - Tara: someone invited him to the server
12/02/2022, 22:02 - Patsy Ng: ok so flow = volume / time

but idk how you'd get the base volume? you can't exactly do 0 time
12/02/2022, 22:02 - Tara: last time i was on discord i accidentally deleted a text channel
12/02/2022, 22:02 - Cindy Yang: o he’s eating rn so in a bit
12/02/2022, 22:02 - Cindy Yang: i also havw to get something to eat lol
12/02/2022, 22:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe we can just make a temporary group?
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: instead of putting it on the server?
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Sienna Lam: zoom
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean if Isabel's on the server he can be too
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Tara: us + all the significant others
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Patsy Ng: or just give him the same role as the people that are just on for dnd
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh we should kick thomas
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Tara: i thought you did already?
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Sienna Lam: ye
12/02/2022, 22:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No I just locked thomas out of the bits we actually use
12/02/2022, 22:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That would simplify things a great deal
12/02/2022, 22:05 - Cindy Yang: ok should i send his discord id or whatwver
12/02/2022, 22:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://discord.gg/BpTBBauk

13/02/2022, 00:24 - Tara: (there are only three of them including Sid)
13/02/2022, 00:24 - Patsy Ng: i think part of the difficulty of saying how much water there is in the nile is that it's not constant

besides the flowing part. bc you know. it's a river. it flows

there's like the dry season and the wet season

and would you count the flooded bits as part of the nile or not
13/02/2022, 00:24 - Tara: Yeah I was gonna say that
13/02/2022, 00:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah, I'm aware, but that's part of what I'm going for

13/02/2022, 02:40 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah @85298583992 

forgot one which is honestly the closest one to 39 apart from long away

holder of the grail by the mechanisms

i think i subconsciously omitted that one bc it's not like. mainstream _music_ music, it's steampunk and the album forms a story that's a futuristic scifi version of the arthurian legends

anyway you don't need to know anything about the album or arthurian legends, it works as a standalone

but it's about the fisher king if you're interested

maybe it's a mixed effect from being stressed about coursework + covid

(idk covid suddenly got a lot more real this week? like i knew it was A Thing before, but it's the first time it's hit people close to me both emotionally and geographically)

14/02/2022, 03:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I doubt it they don't taste at all similar
14/02/2022, 03:30 - Patsy Ng: yeah but it didn't actually taste like chocolate milk
14/02/2022, 03:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think you crashed because you had gotten home from year 5 camp
14/02/2022, 03:30 - Patsy Ng: we just. thought it was chocolate milk bc. none of us had had coffee before
14/02/2022, 03:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because nobody would ever try and pass one off as the other
14/02/2022, 03:30 - Patsy Ng: idk it was Weird chocolate milk
14/02/2022, 03:31 - Damien Fung: maybe it was some off brand soy milk or smth

15/02/2022, 11:55 - Sienna Lam: There is truth technology to extend telomeres but I was like not serious about it so it’s ‘trolling m
15/02/2022, 11:55 - Sienna Lam: Leftists have such small brain
15/02/2022, 12:01 - Sienna Lam: Chemists are so wasteful they throw away all the unused reagents
15/02/2022, 13:14 - Cindy Yang: they should be drinking them instead
15/02/2022, 13:17 - Sienna Lam: Yeee
15/02/2022, 13:17 - Sienna Lam: Then they will become Spider-Man
15/02/2022, 13:17 - Sienna Lam: or get forcefemmed /s
15/02/2022, 13:18 - Merilyn Wong: good soup
15/02/2022, 13:46 - Sienna Lam: fuck canvas
15/02/2022, 13:46 - Sienna Lam: it deleted all my notes again
15/02/2022, 13:46 - Sienna Lam: and didnt evne save a backup even though i tried
15/02/2022, 13:46 - Damien Fung: for a quiz?
15/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: it autosaves after every attempt
15/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: did you lose connection to internet before that?
15/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: oh notes
15/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: nvm
15/02/2022, 13:47 - Damien Fung: wait you can take notes on canvas?
15/02/2022, 13:48 - Sienna Lam: ye and my normal notetaking app spazzes out on certain notes
15/02/2022, 13:57 - Sienna Lam: so i used canvas
15/02/2022, 13:57 - Sienna Lam: but now all my notes are gone
15/02/2022, 14:12 - Sienna Lam: Turns out canvas only stores 50mb roflmao
15/02/2022, 16:56 - Sienna Lam: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 16:57 - Merilyn Wong: hunting insincts intact
15/02/2022, 17:55 - Sienna Lam: @14379874097 what is delta function
15/02/2022, 18:31 - Sienna Lam: we need it for gauss law but this is a first year course roflmao
15/02/2022, 18:31 - Sienna Lam: and not taught in multivariable calculus
15/02/2022, 18:34 - Sienna Lam: @14379874097 why does the tutor do a trigoniometric substitution when you could integrate it directy much faster
15/02/2022, 18:34 - Sienna Lam: w/ implicit integration
15/02/2022, 20:13 - Sienna Lam: Why’s Britain so cringe imperialism and covid
15/02/2022, 20:16 - Sienna Lam: Talking to men normally: ‘hi dude how are u doing’
Talking to men online:
‘Stupid weeb’
15/02/2022, 20:18 - Sienna Lam: Unless that man is my dad in which case we rarely talk
15/02/2022, 20:23 - Rishibh Prakash: The delta function is usually considered to be a function that 1 on exactly one point and 0 everywhere else
15/02/2022, 20:24 - Rishibh Prakash: People integrate however they want to integrate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Sometimes going through the longer method is easier conceptually and you're less prone to make mistakes
15/02/2022, 21:53 - Sienna Lam: Asian women reading my mind is so annoying
15/02/2022, 21:54 - Cindy Yang: ??
15/02/2022, 21:55 - Sienna Lam: https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/15/sport/russia-valieva-figure-skater-doping-scandal-spt-intl-hnk/index.html
15/02/2022, 21:56 - Sienna Lam: Roasted weird Russophobia she’s still allowed to compete I saw her on tv
15/02/2022, 21:56 - Sienna Lam: Ye she’s definitely gonna take doping when she’s under so much scrutiny roflmao therefore they probably found her not guilty of doping in this actual competition
15/02/2022, 21:57 - Merilyn Wong: tbh the rest of the russian team is probably also doped up
15/02/2022, 21:57 - Merilyn Wong: they said if she gets gold there won't be a medal ceremony
15/02/2022, 21:57 - Merilyn Wong: so probably the judging will be rigged so that she gets bronze
15/02/2022, 21:58 - Sienna Lam: No they’re gonna postpone it
15/02/2022, 21:58 - Sienna Lam: nah it’s American propaganda
15/02/2022, 21:58 - Merilyn Wong: https://www.si.com/olympics/2022/02/14/no-medal-ceremony-kamila-valieva-finishes-top-three-ioc
15/02/2022, 21:59 - Sienna Lam: It’s not even the Russia government organising it how is Russia gonna do doping
15/02/2022, 21:59 - Merilyn Wong: because lots of girls are coached by eteri and she puts them all through the same hell
15/02/2022, 22:00 - Merilyn Wong: i just think it's really unfair to pin all the blame on kamila
15/02/2022, 22:00 - Sienna Lam: America literally dragging a little girl through the dirt just to roast Russia
15/02/2022, 22:02 - Sienna Lam: Asian women can always know what I’m thinking
15/02/2022, 22:05 - Sienna Lam: Maybe you should stop believing propaganda
15/02/2022, 22:06 - Merilyn Wong: .....
15/02/2022, 22:06 - Merilyn Wong: this isn't about politics, this is about a coach mistreating athletes
15/02/2022, 22:07 - Sienna Lam: If she was doping every athletes then why isn’t everyone getting tested positive
15/02/2022, 22:07 - Merilyn Wong: russian anti-doping agency warns them before they get tested
15/02/2022, 22:07 - Merilyn Wong: so they have time to flush the drugs from their system
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Sienna Lam: Shut up roflmao I’m leaving this chat for a day
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Merilyn Wong: but there was still some in kamila's system when the test came around
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Sienna Lam: add me back tomorrow
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Merilyn Wong: fuck it im leaving for good i don't need this
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Merilyn Wong left
15/02/2022, 22:08 - Sienna Lam left
15/02/2022, 22:10 - Patsy Ng: well that was intense
15/02/2022, 22:11 - Cindy Yang: o dear
15/02/2022, 22:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ooof
16/02/2022, 00:06 - Tara: What the hell
16/02/2022, 00:07 - Tara: Why did Sienna say stfu
16/02/2022, 00:07 - Tara: That's so out of line
16/02/2022, 00:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I've spoken to her one on one, it shouldn't happen again
16/02/2022, 00:09 - Tara: But in the past few weeks
She's been so _negative_ about things
She's attacking different groups of people just because of her own personal issues
16/02/2022, 00:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
16/02/2022, 00:10 - Tara: Like do you know how exhausting it is to read those arguments and try to rebuke them
16/02/2022, 00:10 - Tara: It's awful
16/02/2022, 00:11 - Tara: And again, it's just because she feels lonely
Like I get that she is and it sucks
But seriously
Attacking other people for it?
16/02/2022, 00:11 - Tara: Not acceptable
16/02/2022, 00:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm glad we're having this convo because it's overdue
16/02/2022, 00:13 - Tara: Oh bless I thought I was in the minority
16/02/2022, 00:18 - Cindy Yang: mm nah her behaviour has been pretty uncomfortable recently
16/02/2022, 00:19 - Cindy Yang: how did that convo go
16/02/2022, 00:19 - Tara: Also I think we need to talk to her about her diet / fitness thing
16/02/2022, 00:20 - Tara: Remember when she said she was scared of eating because she didn't want to gain weight
16/02/2022, 00:20 - Tara: I'm like
Very concerned
16/02/2022, 00:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Could have gone worse 🤷‍♂️
16/02/2022, 00:23 - Patsy Ng: I get where you're coming from but I think no

I feel like recently we've just been. rebuking whatever sienna says (usually bc it's horrible) and it's a bit like attacking her

so if we leave off that then we have to leave off this
16/02/2022, 00:23 - Damien Fung: what did i just wake up to
16/02/2022, 00:25 - Tara: Wait wdym leave off that
16/02/2022, 00:25 - Tara: Children what are we going to do
16/02/2022, 00:27 - Tara: I'm gonna be frank her messages attacking people are so iffy and so frequent I'm really starting to dislike her
16/02/2022, 00:27 - Damien Fung: yeah this
16/02/2022, 00:27 - Damien Fung: oh hey sid
16/02/2022, 00:27 - Siddarth Natarajan: I know I don't say much on this chat, but I would like to just say one thing
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Siddarth Natarajan: Hi Damie
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Siddarth Natarajan: Damien*
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Cindy Yang: damie
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Siddarth Natarajan: I'm sorry, Damien knows how many typos I make
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Damien Fung: i am now dameson wong
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Cindy Yang: it’s aight it be like that sometimes
16/02/2022, 00:28 - Damien Fung: a member of the ozzie folk
16/02/2022, 00:30 - Damien Fung: but yeah she gets so agg so often and it's getting really exhausting
16/02/2022, 00:30 - Siddarth Natarajan: well going back, from a more outsiders perspective (ie arguably my own). I think you guys have done ur fair share of caring. It's up to Sienna to decide what to do now. You can't make someone treat others better or think differently. But the one thing u can do is console those who are hurt, which imo is Merilyn
16/02/2022, 00:31 - Patsy Ng: yeah
16/02/2022, 00:31 - Patsy Ng: eggs gang have talked to meri
16/02/2022, 00:31 - Siddarth Natarajan: thats all I wanted to say, feel free to ignore/disagree. But I think u guys have done ur part
16/02/2022, 00:32 - Patsy Ng: anyway we already talked about this while talking to meri and it feels whiny to rehash it all out in detail here but I do agree with this
16/02/2022, 00:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah as somebody who has already had this conversation twice today I want to empathise and agree but also I don't feel like relitigating it
16/02/2022, 00:33 - Tara: So what do we do
16/02/2022, 00:35 - Damien Fung: should we leave them both to cool down for a day and add them back?
16/02/2022, 00:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meri doesn't want to be readded for the moment due to a heavy workload
16/02/2022, 00:36 - Damien Fung: idk if we need or if we should talk to them again about this considering y'all already talked to them personally
16/02/2022, 00:36 - Damien Fung: aight aight
16/02/2022, 00:36 - Tara: Are y'all willing to bet that she's not going to do this again
16/02/2022, 00:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No
16/02/2022, 00:37 - Tara: Personally I don't
16/02/2022, 00:42 - Tara: Kinda don't want to add her back 👉👈
16/02/2022, 00:45 - Tanushree Banerjee: What
16/02/2022, 00:55 - Tara: So are we gonna add her in a day
Can we add her back when she asks (after a day though) so hopefully she doesn't ask soon
16/02/2022, 00:55 - Tara: I'm sorry guys
16/02/2022, 00:59 - Damien Fung: personally idm
16/02/2022, 01:35 - Tara: Ok so about this
If you don't then what's the point of talking to her
16/02/2022, 01:36 - Tara: Or even being her friend
16/02/2022, 01:37 - Tara: Too extreme? Sorry
16/02/2022, 01:37 - Patsy Ng: i am not willing to bet that she's not gonna do it again

personally i also do not want to add her back

but also. i dislike writing people off

it's. about second chances. third chances. _n_ chances
16/02/2022, 01:38 - Damien Fung: ^
16/02/2022, 01:38 - Tara: N chances??
16/02/2022, 01:38 - Tara: You gotta draw the line somewhere
16/02/2022, 01:39 - Patsy Ng: ik but i don't know my line till someone crosses it
16/02/2022, 01:39 - Tara: Ok fair enough
16/02/2022, 01:39 - Patsy Ng: i'm not saying infinitely many, i'm saying. multiple chances of an unknown quantity
16/02/2022, 01:39 - Tara: Understandable
16/02/2022, 01:40 - Patsy Ng: if you don't want to add her back tho we can do that

bc you're in the group, and you're the one still in it
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Damien Fung: i would call a vote but it seems wrong to call one for some reason
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Dewit
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Rip off the bandaid
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Patsy Ng: yeah
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Patsy Ng: to this
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Anonymous
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Patsy Ng: no
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Or maybe not
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Damien Fung: no but it just doesn't feel right
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Yeah not anonymous
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Damien Fung: ethically
16/02/2022, 01:41 - Patsy Ng: because this isn't a thing that can be decided by majority
16/02/2022, 01:42 - Patsy Ng: bc if one person doesn't consent then we can't force them to do a thing
16/02/2022, 01:42 - Damien Fung: and it's not a thing that one person should decide too without extensive reasoning
16/02/2022, 01:43 - Tara: Yeah I agree with y'all
16/02/2022, 01:43 - Tara: And now I'm thinking again
16/02/2022, 01:43 - Tara: We should still support her
16/02/2022, 01:43 - Tara: But ughhh friends?
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Damien Fung: on a side note we have exactly 2 people in every country
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Damien Fung: rn
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Tara: As in I don't want to be friends with her but I also cannot just leave her alone during this time
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Tara: Omg yeah
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Damien Fung: yeah
16/02/2022, 01:44 - Patsy Ng: you're allowed to put yourself first

don't kill yourself to support sienna
16/02/2022, 01:45 - Tara: Hmmm
16/02/2022, 01:45 - Tara: You're right
16/02/2022, 01:45 - Tara: I want to know what y'all think
16/02/2022, 01:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I am at a social event so like, I will be silent about the current issues for the moment
16/02/2022, 01:46 - Tara: Enjoy
16/02/2022, 01:46 - Damien Fung: have fun!
16/02/2022, 01:46 - Tara: I'm gonna sleep now too
16/02/2022, 01:46 - Tara: Goodnight
16/02/2022, 01:50 - Damien Fung: i think i'm on the same page as you. I've been disliking her more and more over the past few months and so it's hard to be a good friend. 

on the other hand i'm trying to understand her perspective but that's also getting harder due to the assholery.
16/02/2022, 01:52 - Tara: Oh lol completely mildly unrelated turns out I blocked her a while back anyway so if we do add her back I ain't doing it ✨
16/02/2022, 01:52 - Tara: It was after the lesbian argument
16/02/2022, 01:52 - Tara: I'm sorry I go to Lengths to not see people
16/02/2022, 01:53 - Tara: The more I look at what she said the more I despise her
16/02/2022, 01:53 - Tara: So casual
Shut up roflmao
16/02/2022, 01:53 - Tara: Yuck
16/02/2022, 01:54 - Tara: Anyway enough negativity from me sorry about that goodnight
16/02/2022, 01:54 - Tara: No classes tomorrow! My timetable is so wack!
16/02/2022, 01:55 - Tara: Sorry no after that mb
16/02/2022, 01:56 - Cindy Yang: noicee
16/02/2022, 01:56 - Damien Fung: based

16/02/2022, 02:01 - Damien Fung: and it still arrives 2 days early
16/02/2022, 02:01 - Damien Fung: 2 days earlier than the earliest estimate*
16/02/2022, 02:01 - Tara: Damn son
16/02/2022, 02:01 - Damien Fung: i paid for 8 day shipping man

16/02/2022, 02:10 - Damien Fung: preferably when it's not 6am for me
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Tara: Today I ghosted everyone I knew so during the game
Truth: I'm shameless about ghosting people
Lie: [redacted]
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Cindy Yang: lmao o ya u missed it :(
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Damien Fung: man being in 4 timezones is hard
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Tara: Everyone said the lie was the truth
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Tara: Which was funny
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Tara: Since I had ghosted them for an entire day before that
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Damien Fung: F
16/02/2022, 02:10 - Tara: I did explain myself dw
16/02/2022, 02:11 - Tara: And we're all good
16/02/2022, 02:11 - Cindy Yang: indeed
16/02/2022, 02:11 - Tara: Haha you know what's ironic
16/02/2022, 02:11 - Tara: I hope y'all don't mind a mini tiny vent
16/02/2022, 02:11 - Cindy Yang: sure go ahead
16/02/2022, 02:12 - Tara: K so I have a terrible time in confiding with people about problems I'm having
And I had a breakdown about that last night
So obviously my solution was to ghost all my friends instead of confiding my problems
16/02/2022, 02:12 - Tara: I also wanted to see whether I could study for an entire day without checking WhatsApp
Which I did
16/02/2022, 02:12 - Cindy Yang: o no :( r u doing okay?
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Tara: Ya
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Tara: I'vw decided Ayuko is useless because she hasn't helped me with that stuff
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Damien Fung: also unrelated: we're learning error handling in R and prof introduced us to the most redundant function. So usually for errors you use stop to break the program in the event of an error

prof then introduced warning. which you can use in the event of an error but that doesn't break the code and just prints your error message to your working console or whatever

but then i was like "wait can't you use print for that?" and she was like "yep. it's the exact same. but named warning"
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Tara: Which is literally my biggest problem with the whole helper thing
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Tara: Anyway thanks for listening
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Cindy Yang: :( oof
16/02/2022, 02:13 - Damien Fung: :(((((((((((((
16/02/2022, 02:14 - Cindy Yang: that sucks :(

16/02/2022, 02:14 - Cindy Yang: ❤️ sending love
16/02/2022, 02:14 - Tara: I- it's like that thing in python too right
16/02/2022, 02:14 - Tara: There's some exception print function
16/02/2022, 02:14 - Cindy Yang: do u wanna tell us about the problems or nah? either way we support u, *hug*
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Damien Fung: try except?
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Tara: except Exception as e: print(e)
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Tara: Oh nevermind
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Tara: Not redundant
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Damien Fung: no that's useful bc it stops the program
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Tara: No I'm good but thank you anyway
Hope it's not too much btw
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Damien Fung: like warning is the exact same as print
16/02/2022, 02:15 - Damien Fung: but named warning
16/02/2022, 02:16 - Tara: Amazing
16/02/2022, 02:16 - Tara: Good job R

16/02/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: I think there's an online r environment thing
16/02/2022, 03:23 - Patsy Ng: we could have used it last year for stats but I chose not to bc it was gonna be deleted after the module ended
16/02/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: just so i don't have to reinstall my environment for courses on my PC
16/02/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: bc my PC's environment's made for when i was working on my EE

16/02/2022, 03:36 - Damien Fung: i put in random workings that looked correct to pretend i did the maths
16/02/2022, 03:36 - Damien Fung: and like a week after submission i asked my friends what they put and turns out i wrote the wrong thing
16/02/2022, 03:36 - Damien Fung: but i still got full marks for the question
16/02/2022, 03:47 - Cindy Yang: nicee

16/02/2022, 04:36 - Rishibh Prakash: Mayhaps
16/02/2022, 04:36 - Cindy Yang: you're not alone
16/02/2022, 04:37 - Rishibh Prakash: I've not been very healthy these past few weeks (months?) so trying to change that
16/02/2022, 04:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i would say most of the chat hasn't
16/02/2022, 04:37 - Damien Fung: mood i ate nothing but leftover pizza, 2 cookies, and a protein shake yesterday
16/02/2022, 04:37 - Cindy Yang: lmao employer and employee in german are arbeitgeber and arbeitnehmer which means work giver and work taker
16/02/2022, 04:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i have had two pizzas in as many days
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: bro
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Rishibh Prakash: Ha ha, I just eat nothing a lot of the time
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh while sienna's not on this chat I may as well speak about my eating habits
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: :(
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I basically
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I eat when I need to sustain myself
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: or I binge eat
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then I go days without eating at all
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Rishibh Prakash: Same
16/02/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: r you guys doing okay
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think part of it is that whenever I'm feeling a lack of energy I assume it's fatigue and drink tea?
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Rishibh Prakash: Trying to become a tad more healthy
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Cindy Yang: do y'all have snacks at home
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Rishibh Prakash: Maybe going over 24 hours without meals isn't the best
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Damien Fung: yeah i just woke up like 10 mins before getting coffee with isabel and i had a photoshoot like 30 mins after that so i had to dash out before getting lunch
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Rishibh Prakash: Just maybe
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Cindy Yang: a small possibility
16/02/2022, 04:39 - Damien Fung: bought cookies when i had a short break before an online lecture at 4 so ate those
16/02/2022, 04:40 - Damien Fung: and pizza was leftover from the day before
16/02/2022, 04:40 - Patsy Ng: guys please eat regularly
16/02/2022, 04:40 - Damien Fung: protein shake was after working out but that's not really a meal
16/02/2022, 04:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: at least I drink enough!
16/02/2022, 04:40 - Cindy Yang: ^^

16/02/2022, 04:43 - Patsy Ng: when the canteen is doing meals I usually get the veggie options

I don't think I've had meat meat in like. two weeks maybe and the last time I had fish was last friday

when. I have to "cook" I either hoard food from the canteen or make a giant microwave cupcake or have microwave rice, but sometimes I get giant loaves of sourdough for free
16/02/2022, 04:43 - Rishibh Prakash: wait do you not qualify fish as meat
16/02/2022, 04:43 - Cindy Yang: waow where do u get the sourdough from

16/02/2022, 04:44 - Patsy Ng: sometimes I volunteer at this eco organization and we get tons of food donations we aren't legally allowed to donate bc it's past the date or ripped a bit so we have to consume them
16/02/2022, 04:45 - Patsy Ng: which also means I usually have to eat the loaf within a couple days
16/02/2022, 04:45 - Patsy Ng: I do qualify fish as meat tho

18/02/2022, 01:28 - Damien Fung: before you ask yes i called customer service 4 times asking where my stuff was
18/02/2022, 01:28 - Damien Fung: yessir
18/02/2022, 01:28 - Patsy Ng: do you even still have the camera the bag is for
18/02/2022, 01:28 - Damien Fung: i mean i still have all my gear?
18/02/2022, 01:29 - Damien Fung: just changed systems back in august
18/02/2022, 01:29 - Patsy Ng: ohh OK not a specific camera bag then just a general camera bag
18/02/2022, 01:30 - Damien Fung: store had a very generous coupon of 100 CAD for me since i bought my new system from them so i picked up a practically free premium bag
18/02/2022, 01:30 - Damien Fung: but they ran out of stock right as i bought it and the restock got stuck in customs so yeah 3 months

18/02/2022, 03:09 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 03:11 - Cindy Yang: u guys ever eaten grass
18/02/2022, 03:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah
18/02/2022, 03:11 - Cindy Yang: damn
18/02/2022, 03:12 - Cindy Yang: taking ‘touch grass’ a bit too far
18/02/2022, 03:12 - Cindy Yang: was it tasty
18/02/2022, 03:12 - Cindy Yang: does grass taste good to cows
18/02/2022, 03:12 - Cindy Yang: do they have enzymes for breaking down cellulose in their saliva
18/02/2022, 03:16 - Patsy Ng: yeah
18/02/2022, 03:17 - Cindy Yang: pat do u know
18/02/2022, 03:17 - Patsy Ng: idk
18/02/2022, 03:17 - Patsy Ng: presumably?
18/02/2022, 03:18 - Patsy Ng: like. ik their lips can feel which blades are best and they just eat the nice ones
18/02/2022, 03:18 - Cindy Yang: :0 very cool
18/02/2022, 03:18 - Patsy Ng: but unless you can read a cow's mind you don't know if they experience taste the same way we do
18/02/2022, 03:19 - Patsy Ng: bc maybe they just like it bc it's fresh or sth
18/02/2022, 03:19 - Cindy Yang: fair
18/02/2022, 03:19 - Cindy Yang: wondering if they got taste receptors specific to grass
18/02/2022, 03:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe they see eating as a chore
18/02/2022, 03:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or maybe they get the same receptors but their brain sees it differently
18/02/2022, 03:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or like, maybe it's like how water doesn't taste of anything but it's still good
18/02/2022, 03:21 - Cindy Yang: o also so like i was thinking wait cellulose is made of glucose same as starch maybe they also got enzymes for making cellulose into glucose but then i was like wait but we eat starch not because it tastes sweet and then i searched it up and apparently starch is its own taste which seems kinda obvious in retrospect lmao
18/02/2022, 03:22 - Cindy Yang: mm
18/02/2022, 03:23 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 03:23 - Cindy Yang: i see

18/02/2022, 03:24 - Cindy Yang: altho actually it was just one study so who knows
18/02/2022, 03:25 - Patsy Ng: i mean i guess you could run experiments

extract a grass flavour and make a solid block of food (that isn't shaped as grass) and make a couple more with diff flavours and make them recognizably different visually and see which ones cows like mroe
18/02/2022, 03:25 - Cindy Yang: mm
18/02/2022, 03:25 - Cindy Yang: that’d be cool
18/02/2022, 03:27 - Cindy Yang: wanna get some soda but i don’t have a bottle free to fill it up so i’m considering using my unwashed coffee cup

19/02/2022, 00:29 - Tara: Yep
19/02/2022, 00:29 - Tara: And use the initial condition M(0)=1 as your bound
19/02/2022, 00:29 - Cindy Yang: aight
19/02/2022, 00:29 - Tara: M is from 1->M

20/02/2022, 14:00 - Cindy Yang: use agarose gel, hook it up to stuff so that one hand positively charged and other negatively charged, put dna in it, moves towards positive side and separates according to size cos larger dna fragments move slower

21/02/2022, 05:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh also all the heterosexual couples in this movie are *egregiously* horny
21/02/2022, 05:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like there's a dancing scene which is just like, please stop moaning you're in public????

the straight couples are just trying to fuck constantly basically and they only barely calm down after somebody dies
21/02/2022, 05:40 - Cindy Yang: bruh
21/02/2022, 05:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: at one point in a dancing scene a character lifts another and puts her on his shoulders piggyback style, but the other way round so his face is just entirely pressed against her gal gadotussy (also they met like five seconds ago and he's engaged to another woman)
21/02/2022, 05:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: just absolutely nuts
21/02/2022, 05:42 - Cindy Yang: ://///////////////////////////:://

21/02/2022, 17:36 - Damien Fung: so converting word to pdf works differently depending on how you save it
21/02/2022, 17:36 - Damien Fung: if you save it as adobe pdf you can use embedded links but if you save as a copy and you change the file type to pdf you can't use embedded links
21/02/2022, 17:45 - Patsy Ng: wait really
21/02/2022, 17:45 - Patsy Ng: I've been doing the latter all the time bc whenever I do the conversion thing it takes ages and all my links work fine
21/02/2022, 17:46 - Sienna Lam: Maybe it’s an OS thing

22/02/2022, 07:00 - Patsy Ng: ... are you having dinner at 11 pm?
22/02/2022, 07:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yes
22/02/2022, 07:00 - Damien Fung: string cheese is fine but i think there's a compound on it which prevents it from clumping with itself so it might be worse if you want it to emulsify
22/02/2022, 07:00 - Damien Fung: ik for sure pre shredded cheese has that compound
22/02/2022, 07:01 - Patsy Ng: fair enough
22/02/2022, 07:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah maybe, I'll try a different cheese!

22/02/2022, 16:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think on the women end of the scale it's mostly oppression manifesting, but I have no idea what's going on with men
22/02/2022, 16:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There's no intuitive reason for the effects to affect bi women more but maybe it's like, less community support or sth
22/02/2022, 16:13 - Sienna Lam: Gay men are more oppressed than lesbians arguably
22/02/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Nah, they're men
22/02/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And it's not specifically about oppression manifest
22/02/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Different situations can manifest in different ways
22/02/2022, 16:33 - Sienna Lam: Cuz bi men get bullied by everyone including women and no one bullies lgbt women as much
22/02/2022, 16:36 - Sienna Lam: Lecturer added surprise project that replaces the exam

22/02/2022, 23:36 - Patsy Ng: mmm söüp
22/02/2022, 23:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: gonna get really fussy about the pronunciation of diaresis for no reason
22/02/2022, 23:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: should be soüp
22/02/2022, 23:37 - Patsy Ng: ök
22/02/2022, 23:38 - Patsy Ng: also why

doesn't the diaresis pronunciation change depending on which language is using it
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah but in English the use of diaresis is usually the distinguishing of adjacent vowels from dipthongs
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Patsy Ng: wait do we use it in english???
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like naïve, coöperate, citroën
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Patsy Ng: ohhh yeah
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Patsy Ng: just for naive tho

did not know about the others
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or, not dipthongs
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Digraphs
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
22/02/2022, 23:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Na-ive instead of nayve
22/02/2022, 23:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I believe "soup" is already a front vowel so you can't umlaut it either
22/02/2022, 23:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There are two times of day for me, tea time (before six) and chips time (after six)
22/02/2022, 23:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Foolproof system
22/02/2022, 23:43 - Patsy Ng: you eat chips every day?
22/02/2022, 23:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No but I don't really think they're appropriate before six
22/02/2022, 23:44 - Patsy Ng: like. chips, like the sort you have with fish, aren't appropriate before six?
22/02/2022, 23:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah
22/02/2022, 23:45 - Patsy Ng: why tho
22/02/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: vibes

23/02/2022, 07:08 - Cindy Yang: is that what karen was told
23/02/2022, 07:08 - Patsy Ng: to get me to eat my rice my parents were just like "think of how much work it was for the cows to till the fields"
23/02/2022, 07:08 - Patsy Ng: yes

23/02/2022, 12:29 - Sienna Lam: graphene has a pretty high dielectric constant and is 1 atom thick

23/02/2022, 22:07 - Cindy Yang: lmao i saw the clue and was like oh atlanta and then oh but maybe it's presumptuous of me to assume they mean here it's probably the country but then i looked at the crossword and was like well it fits
23/02/2022, 22:07 - Patsy Ng: nice
23/02/2022, 22:31 - Tara: Y'all yesterday was October 114th
23/02/2022, 22:31 - Tara: It was also two'sday
23/02/2022, 22:43 - Patsy Ng: OK got round to reading this and are these people in a completely different world or what
23/02/2022, 22:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I thought this was gonna be a "kids don't memorise things hurr durr" article but now I'm reading it and wow that's genuinely conxerning
23/02/2022, 22:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Stuff like Google docs kinda discourages thinking in directories tho so I get it
23/02/2022, 22:48 - Cindy Yang: yea it seems very unbelievable to me but perhaps we are outliers
23/02/2022, 22:49 - Tara: Oh god i thought this was fake
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: it can't be real can it
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: maybe it's another "what is the American education system doing" thing
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Tara: Do people not use files offline
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Tara: Like how
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Cindy Yang: perhaps
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Tbh i'm halfway between the two models
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: bc I think all these people are from american unis
23/02/2022, 22:54 - Tara: We're gen z we grew up with this
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: I thought it would be old people who wouldn't know how to use it
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For a specific project I will make a folder, but for stuff I don't intend to keep track of long term it just hangs out in Downloads until I mass delete
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Cindy Yang: i see
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Patsy Ng: also. the fucking programmer that doesn't know how file directories work

how is that person passing their courses
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Yeah omg
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Do they not work with then
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Like what are they doing
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Or do they use relative pathways
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Tara: But seriously what
23/02/2022, 22:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: On Google drive idc because if something is relevant it will be in Recent
23/02/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For programming obviously I use folders
23/02/2022, 22:56 - Patsy Ng: that's still knowing how directories work
23/02/2022, 22:56 - Tara: Weird
23/02/2022, 22:56 - Patsy Ng: I think it's implied their code editor makes a project file for them and they never stray from the defaults?
23/02/2022, 22:56 - Tara: I can't trust that this article is real because what
23/02/2022, 22:57 - Patsy Ng: oh I turned that off for all my drives bc if I was working on sth personal before I don't want it to come up whenever I open up drive in front of people
23/02/2022, 22:57 - Tara: I only use Google drive to collaborate with classmates
23/02/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Because jeez OneDrive sucks
23/02/2022, 22:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ez: if you don't name your files and pull them up based on Vibes nobody can tell what they are
23/02/2022, 22:58 - Patsy Ng: yeah I feel like it's. been really nitpicked? like the author heard one offhand comment and then decided to spin a whole story out of it
23/02/2022, 22:58 - Patsy Ng: just for like. the views
23/02/2022, 22:58 - Cindy Yang: perhaps
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Cindy Yang: i'm gonna carry out my own investigations
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Are you gonna survey people
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Cindy Yang: yea
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Cindy Yang: just ask everyone i meet
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Hey do you know how to use files
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Cindy Yang: have already seen my bf's desktop and he says he doesn't organize anything
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Patsy Ng: Pain
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Oh god no
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Why
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Patsy Ng: isn't he a compsci major
23/02/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Selvin no
23/02/2022, 23:00 - Cindy Yang: not yet
23/02/2022, 23:00 - Cindy Yang: plus hasn't had any actual schooling in compsci before
23/02/2022, 23:00 - Patsy Ng: ~and he never will be at this rate~
23/02/2022, 23:00 - Tara: Ouch
23/02/2022, 23:00 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
23/02/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: yeah so what! did he not learn to use folders as soon as he made his first ever file???
23/02/2022, 23:03 - Patsy Ng: wait you have to ask where they studied as well

so we can figure out if it's an education system thing
23/02/2022, 23:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He puts stuff on his desktop?
23/02/2022, 23:04 - Cindy Yang: idk not everything probably
23/02/2022, 23:04 - Cindy Yang: there were just a bunch of icons and i was like why don't u organise that
23/02/2022, 23:04 - Cindy Yang: lmao aight
23/02/2022, 23:05 - Cindy Yang: https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pwn278/students_dont_know_what_files_and_folders_are/ some discussion on it
23/02/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't actually bother with my desktop, it fills up with random crap shortcuts while everything I actually use is in like a couple of folders
23/02/2022, 23:11 - Tara: Isn't that just the same as putting everything on the desktop
The clutter my gosh
23/02/2022, 23:11 - Tara: Unless you have subfolders

23/02/2022, 23:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Trying to do literally any minor shit on Linux is the most effective way to teach yourself the underlying structures you take for granted on windows
23/02/2022, 23:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Usually I would, but I'm using a VPS rn which means graphical isn't really an option

24/02/2022, 07:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: things that went viral over the pandemic
24/02/2022, 07:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like
24/02/2022, 07:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tiger king
24/02/2022, 07:02 - Cindy Yang: the virus
24/02/2022, 07:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Specifically things that people liked discussing online
24/02/2022, 07:02 - Patsy Ng: among us?
24/02/2022, 07:02 - Patsy Ng: sourdough bread / baking
24/02/2022, 07:03 - Cindy Yang: wordle
24/02/2022, 07:03 - Cindy Yang: squid game
24/02/2022, 07:03 - Patsy Ng: jorts (unbuttered)
24/02/2022, 07:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: specifically things which were weekly or continuous and non-interactive
24/02/2022, 07:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so not Amogus because that was interactive, not sourdough because it was individual
24/02/2022, 07:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Not Wordle because I'm writing about Wordle anyway
24/02/2022, 07:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Not Squid game because that was released all at once
24/02/2022, 07:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: not jorts because jorts are actually really personal
24/02/2022, 07:06 - Patsy Ng: bit morbid but. obsessively checking case counts every day for like the first few months of the pandemic
24/02/2022, 08:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eakqKxR6b2V6xjgCE2rRKzmumvxVZXp92zyExeY0u4/edit?usp=sharing

24/02/2022, 08:47 - Patsy Ng: isn't it wild that another storm has already come and gone since storm eunice
24/02/2022, 08:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah
24/02/2022, 08:47 - Patsy Ng: i didn't even know it was a thing until afterwards
24/02/2022, 08:50 - Patsy Ng: if you want to involve maths i believe there's a nerdle where you have to guess a mathematical equation

24/02/2022, 08:57 - Patsy Ng: haven't tried it

just watched someone play it
24/02/2022, 08:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no I mean of the article
24/02/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: it's really well phrased

obv it's opinionated but it's an opinion piece, so that's ok
24/02/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: wondering how you plan to do footnotes tho

like is blog format great for them
24/02/2022, 08:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's not, but I'm thinking I might be able to uh
24/02/2022, 08:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hovery things
24/02/2022, 08:59 - Patsy Ng: hmm

iirc they're called titles in html?
24/02/2022, 08:59 - Patsy Ng: that might depend on whether you get to edit the post's html tho
24/02/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think I ought to be allowed to?
24/02/2022, 09:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In any case they're all optional
24/02/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: yeah but they add a certain terry-pratchettesque flavour
24/02/2022, 09:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah, that was exactly what i was going for!
24/02/2022, 09:05 - Patsy Ng: nice
24/02/2022, 09:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I really like the way my writing voice is developing tbh
24/02/2022, 09:10 - Patsy Ng: yee it's Good
24/02/2022, 09:11 - Patsy Ng: oh this was just us but crosswords
24/02/2022, 09:12 - Patsy Ng: like. we made them interactive but just bc we're not smart enough to complete them individually
24/02/2022, 09:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Crosswords are a good example because people can commiserate and collaborate over them
24/02/2022, 09:22 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo i made that trope mistake as well
24/02/2022, 09:22 - Patsy Ng: same
24/02/2022, 09:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: too online, all of us
24/02/2022, 09:24 - Patsy Ng: the exact thing i thought after completing that wordle was "i read too much fanfiction"
24/02/2022, 09:25 - Patsy Ng: what went through your head when you put "trode" down tho
24/02/2022, 09:25 - Patsy Ng: hmm i thought you'd have touched on wordle's migration to nyt
24/02/2022, 09:26 - Cindy Yang: funky article

24/02/2022, 09:29 - Patsy Ng: didn't really get what you meant by open classes

like. as opposed to closed classes? 

wouldn't all words be open classes then, instead of just verbs, adjectives, and nouns?
24/02/2022, 09:30 - Patsy Ng: or is that compared to stuff like. connectives, where yeah you can make stuff up but it's harder for people to know what you mean
24/02/2022, 09:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah that
24/02/2022, 09:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: pronouns are also supposed to be a closed class but nowadays less so
24/02/2022, 09:32 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>

24/02/2022, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah maybe
24/02/2022, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: or I might just go "i observed it in a dream"
24/02/2022, 09:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and leave it there
24/02/2022, 09:36 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>

24/02/2022, 09:46 - Cindy Yang: o that reminds me in german class someone was doing a presentation on german cars and apparently audi was merged from four companies one of which was named horch
24/02/2022, 09:46 - Cindy Yang: and then the prof made us guess what horch meant
24/02/2022, 09:47 - Cindy Yang: and i was thinking hark cos it looked similar but i kinda forgot what that meant so i didn't say it
24/02/2022, 09:47 - Tara: Was it a hark
24/02/2022, 09:47 - Cindy Yang: but not far off the mark actually cos they both mean listen
24/02/2022, 09:48 - Cindy Yang: maybe same etymological origin

26/02/2022, 01:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Technically I could have mashed potatoes instead but like
26/02/2022, 01:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah because people *insist* on hanging out in the kitchen
26/02/2022, 01:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meaning I cannot eat
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Anything which cannot be prepared on my desk
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Patsy Ng: and please tell me you didn't just take that photo
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I did
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Patsy Ng: it's 17:30
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Cindy Yang: bruh
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: well, it's Lunch 2
26/02/2022, 01:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I finished my first Lunch (also rice) at lunchtime but it's literally just rice
26/02/2022, 01:31 - Patsy Ng: ah wacko
26/02/2022, 01:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: wait that's a lie sorry, days blending. I am eating for the first time at 5 yes
26/02/2022, 01:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The first bowl was actually dinner yesterday
26/02/2022, 01:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I tried to eat at noon but I set the oven to preheat and then people sat in the kitchen for *hours* and I eventually gave up
26/02/2022, 01:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I can't just tell people to vacate the kitchen bc I'm diseased or sth
26/02/2022, 01:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can't even have instant noodles because I only had two in my room and I live with white people who wouldn't know where to buy them
26/02/2022, 01:33 - Patsy Ng: why not
26/02/2022, 01:33 - Cindy Yang: i mean i feel like that’s a valid reason
26/02/2022, 02:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they could be cookign or eating or working?
26/02/2022, 02:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I ended up waiting for the kitchen to be empty and put up a paper sign that said not to get too comfy because I'd be coming in at a specific time
26/02/2022, 02:16 - Patsy Ng: mm

they really only need to be in if they're cooking tho
26/02/2022, 02:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lol I asked to use the kitchen for 45 minutes and now I'm getting passive aggressive messages about sanitising door handles
26/02/2022, 02:29 - Sienna Lam: Tbh they should cook for you instead of you using the kitchen
26/02/2022, 02:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk these people like that, I literally just live in the same building
26/02/2022, 02:30 - Damien Fung: how long's your isolation period?
26/02/2022, 02:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: best case scenario is until the first
26/02/2022, 02:31 - Damien Fung: damn
26/02/2022, 02:43 - Patsy Ng: y'all know how like. the hippie movement coincided with the vietnam war bc it was the first war to be widely televised

and like. how not many people watch channel tv now bc streaming is such a big thing

do y'all think it's made a change in the way the war is perceived
26/02/2022, 02:46 - Patsy Ng: btw by "the war" I mean the one that just started like. yesterday
26/02/2022, 02:47 - Sienna Lam: Social media means u get live stuff from the front
26/02/2022, 02:48 - Patsy Ng: yeah but like. social media is more. disjointed I guess

people watch different things and social media clips are usually shorter
26/02/2022, 04:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm very distressed and idk if it's the quar
26/02/2022, 04:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's probs the quar
26/02/2022, 04:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I feel like I can neither focus nor relax
26/02/2022, 04:36 - Cindy Yang: :(((( that’s rough
26/02/2022, 04:37 - Damien Fung: :((((((
26/02/2022, 04:38 - Cindy Yang: hope u feel better soon
26/02/2022, 05:00 - Cindy Yang: went to get something to eat before class and the closest place was starbucks but it’s taking forever so i’m on track to actually showing up fifteen minutes late to class with starbucks
26/02/2022, 07:23 - Damien Fung: o o f
26/02/2022, 07:23 - Damien Fung: was it bc the line was long or just slow service
26/02/2022, 07:29 - Cindy Yang: they forgot my order lol
26/02/2022, 07:30 - Cindy Yang: i ordered a muffin and i had to go ask about it
26/02/2022, 07:39 - Damien Fung: oh bruh
26/02/2022, 07:44 - Cindy Yang: 😔
26/02/2022, 08:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
26/02/2022, 08:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Might write a story
26/02/2022, 08:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I say "might," it's an assignment, I have to
26/02/2022, 08:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But specifically a story about being on a date except you're spacing out and he's ranting animatedly about Lo Ting
26/02/2022, 08:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Patsy Ng: oof do you wanna talk about it

if you want we could do a discord call this weekend
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Patsy Ng: sounds. interesting.
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Not based on anything real but I want to capture the feeling of not feeling yourself and not being able to properly process spoken words
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like imagine you're kind of
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Patsy Ng: is this based on real events where you are the data ranting about lo ting
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Patsy Ng: *date
26/02/2022, 08:07 - Cindy Yang: lo ting?
26/02/2022, 08:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You know how sometimes somebody has been talking for a few minutes and they're like "you get what I mean?" and you kinda have to go "... Sorry, can you repeat everything"
26/02/2022, 08:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If it were real I would be both people on the date, but it is not based on real events
26/02/2022, 08:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I just think it would be funny to resurface from your thoughts in the middle of a conversation and your convo partner is going like "Anyway, he's completely naked, but he has the head of a fish"
26/02/2022, 08:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I also think lo ting could be interpreted symbolically as somebody who is very simple and open and forthright but who you still can't quite figure out? Like, a completely bare human shaped figure with hands and feet and so on, but also his head is a fish?

26/02/2022, 19:27 - Tara: This clears up nothing
26/02/2022, 19:28 - Patsy Ng: you might even say

it's as clear as mud
26/02/2022, 19:28 - Sienna Lam: Dalai Lama Island
26/02/2022, 20:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/02/2022, 20:23 - Tara: UST is an ally
26/02/2022, 20:23 - Tara: Forbidden Hubba bubba
26/02/2022, 20:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hhh
26/02/2022, 22:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh North Korean pop music kinda slaps
26/02/2022, 22:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 배우자 a bop
26/02/2022, 22:41 - Patsy Ng: where are you finding north kpop
26/02/2022, 22:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: YouTube
26/02/2022, 22:41 - Patsy Ng: wack
26/02/2022, 22:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://youtu.be/ycdDHP7QfWo
26/02/2022, 22:50 - Patsy Ng: that was. a trip
26/02/2022, 22:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It sounds like a song in Chess that would be satirising communist music
26/02/2022, 22:51 - Patsy Ng: oh my god it kind of does
26/02/2022, 22:51 - Patsy Ng: also it sounds more like. rock than pop
26/02/2022, 22:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like the random incorporation of stately matters because the writers wanted to convey those things and still have pop music
26/02/2022, 22:52 - Patsy Ng: also the emphasis on study + knowledge
26/02/2022, 22:52 - Patsy Ng: that was so. weird but also kind of refreshing???
26/02/2022, 22:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah it slaps
26/02/2022, 22:53 - Patsy Ng: also it was kind of weird bc those hairstyles are from ages ago

they have the vibe of being our parents' ages
26/02/2022, 22:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think they might be tbh
26/02/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: yeah
26/02/2022, 22:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Although your parents are younger than mine
26/02/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: that's. kind of cool bc most _pop groups now are made of people who just. have to be funneled into the pop star lifestyle before they're old enough to really know what they're getting into
26/02/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nah these are north koreans, they've probably been funneled into it since birth
26/02/2022, 22:56 - Patsy Ng: the pop star lifestyle?
26/02/2022, 22:57 - Patsy Ng: like. the nk govt just. picked out some babies and decided to make them kpop stars??
26/02/2022, 22:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i mean
26/02/2022, 22:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no they probably don't live the pop star lifestyle

03/03/2022, 22:25 - Tara: out from bottom in from top
03/03/2022, 22:25 - Tara: the better way is to poke it through the top thread it through the bottom then pull
03/03/2022, 22:25 - Tara: you know what i mean
03/03/2022, 22:25 - Patsy Ng: no i do not

03/03/2022, 22:37 - Patsy Ng: didn't we get taught that way was worse in primary school
03/03/2022, 22:37 - Patsy Ng: bc it made people pull the needle instead of push it
03/03/2022, 22:37 - Tara: it's much faster tbh
03/03/2022, 22:37 - Tara: oh that's why people wear thimbles
03/03/2022, 22:37 - Patsy Ng: yeah it's faster but they said it was also messier

04/03/2022, 02:09 - Patsy Ng: the uni in general just slaps all the learning resources on moodle or panopto, the compsci faculty has just. a resource sharing network with no frills attached just files and directories

for submitting stuff we all use a thing called mms, short for module management system
04/03/2022, 02:09 - Patsy Ng: announcements go through outlook or teams
04/03/2022, 02:09 - Cindy Yang: damn
04/03/2022, 02:09 - Patsy Ng: submission deadlines are on mms and they get mentioned in lectures and they also send out emails when they put stuff up

04/03/2022, 02:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: doesn't getting out of quar imply no longer being infectious???
04/03/2022, 02:13 - Tanushree Banerjee: It’s not my fault
04/03/2022, 02:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, I wasn't allowed out until two consecutive days iwth negative lat flows
04/03/2022, 02:13 - Tanushree Banerjee: What unis isolation protocol is
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Patsy Ng: wait are you going on the trip or is your roommate going on the trip
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Tanushree Banerjee: No
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which was good because I had run out of food
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Tanushree Banerjee: Roommate and boyfriend honeymoon
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Damien Fung: i mean fair but since you're paying fair rent too ask them to pay for those 5 days

04/03/2022, 02:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: since they wanna honeymoon so bad
04/03/2022, 02:14 - Tanushree Banerjee: Well
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Tanushree Banerjee: Hadley is living in Hugh’s room now
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Tanushree Banerjee: Hugh basically has a single
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Tanushree Banerjee: A two room double
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the thing is I would totally say "yeah I'll do it" and live somewhere else for five days, but that's because I am terrified of inconveniencing people
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Tanushree Banerjee: She even sleeps there everyday
04/03/2022, 02:15 - Cindy Yang: i think u don’t have to like respond to this specifically but u should probably still like. work this out with ur roomie

04/03/2022, 02:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: Question is why is the boyfriend relaying the request to me
04/03/2022, 02:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: Boyfriend isn’t my roommate

04/03/2022, 02:17 - Damien Fung: wait
04/03/2022, 02:17 - Cindy Yang: instead of talking to the boyfriend
04/03/2022, 02:17 - Tanushree Banerjee: Well I did
04/03/2022, 02:18 - Patsy Ng: idk maybe hadley asked him to bc she wanted to avoid direct conflict with you

04/03/2022, 02:22 - Patsy Ng: both sides are valid

he's asking a lot from you but also. it's covid and they spent a ton of money on their trip, so i guess it's understandable that he's being self-interested
04/03/2022, 02:22 - Tanushree Banerjee: Bc we used to be good friends

09/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: The one whose head was stolen
09/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: Presumably by kcl students
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: Catholics have this thing where they kind of worship the relics (remaining body parts + sometimes their personal effects) of saints

bc saints are holy
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: Ah
Lemme reread it
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: Maybe make this more obvious?
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: John Stuart Mill?
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: Jeremy Bentham
09/03/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: hmm ok
09/03/2022, 23:49 - Patsy Ng: starts with a j close enough
09/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: Yeah
09/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: Otherwise
Very informative
09/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: Religious people are crazy
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: Ngl though I highly doubt they're worshipping his actual skull
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Patsy Ng: same
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Patsy Ng: i have like. a page of notes just tracking where each body part went and when
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: Ooh interesting
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: Where did they end up
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Patsy Ng: didn't end up using a lot of it but yeah it got very confusing towards the end
09/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: Ah that sucks
09/03/2022, 23:53 - Tara: Ok I gotta sleep now
09/03/2022, 23:53 - Tara: I like your article
09/03/2022, 23:53 - Patsy Ng: i think the vatican city and amalfi, italy have most of it

edinburgh got a shoulder blade in 1879 and they have the skull bit from 1969 as well

various other places like patras, greece, and karpaz, cyprus say they have some but none of the academic sources i've looked at said anything about it
09/03/2022, 23:55 - Tara: Ah weirdos
09/03/2022, 23:55 - Patsy Ng: oooh wait
09/03/2022, 23:55 - Patsy Ng: the weirdest part
09/03/2022, 23:57 - Patsy Ng: is that catholics think that relics sometimes produce a holy oil called manna

and apparently in 1846 the relics in amalfi just. started producing it

for no reason

like they'd been dead and were doing nothing for like. 1800 years 

but then they just started making oil
09/03/2022, 23:57 - Tara: Nooo
09/03/2022, 23:58 - Tara: Can't believe I'm googling skull oil
09/03/2022, 23:59 - Patsy Ng: here's the relic oil source if you want

https://www.stmaryscathedral.co.uk/standrew/
10/03/2022, 00:00 - Tara: Ah thank you
10/03/2022, 00:00 - Tara: These search results were not helpful
10/03/2022, 00:02 - Tara: Imagine being executed then someone deciding that day should be celebrated with a feast

10/03/2022, 00:03 - Tara: Will Google this after
10/03/2022, 00:05 - Tara: Did Andrew even visit Scotland when he was alive
10/03/2022, 00:05 - Patsy Ng: no
10/03/2022, 00:06 - Patsy Ng: the kyiv story very probably isn't true either, as is the Romanian one

10/03/2022, 00:27 - Damien Fung: oooooooooo
10/03/2022, 00:28 - Damien Fung: it's overall p good
10/03/2022, 00:29 - Damien Fung: but something about the kyiv intro feels off? not so sure what tho
10/03/2022, 00:29 - Patsy Ng: hmm yeah probably
10/03/2022, 00:29 - Patsy Ng: that was the bit i wrote at 3 am

10/03/2022, 00:30 - Damien Fung: valid
10/03/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: unrelated but i searched up every 2nd year stat major in this one course required for co-op and found there were only 6 of us in there and only one of them were significantly ahead of us
10/03/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: and by that i mean top 5% of ubc science
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Damien Fung: turns out my friend's friend is friends with her and so now my friend's trying to bring her into our study group
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Damien Fung: ya boi's about to get hard carried
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Patsy Ng: what do you mean significantly ahead
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Huh wdym
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Ah
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Ok
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Cindy Yang: lmao nice
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Damien Fung: all 2nd year stat majors in the course have only taken up to this course in terms of 3rd year courses except for me and that girl
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Damien Fung: but instead of 2 extra data science courses she's taken like 5 honours stats courses
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Patsy Ng: bruh
10/03/2022, 00:38 - Tara: Love how the western Roman empire collapsed in 400AD but the eastern Roman empire survived another 1000 years

10/03/2022, 00:40 - Tara: Oops guess we're gonna repeat history
10/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: wait

a factor of the collapse of the western roman empire?
10/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: wow
10/03/2022, 00:42 - Tara: Ok it was more indirect
10/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Like climate change led to something which was then a factor contributing to the collapse of the empire
10/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: I will update you tomorrow goodnight
10/03/2022, 00:44 - Tara: And an epidemic!

14/03/2022, 07:16 - Cindy Yang: man every time the bf comes over i think we spend most of our time just napping together

14/03/2022, 07:16 - Damien Fung: that's like the best part of a relationship
14/03/2022, 07:16 - Damien Fung: just napping
14/03/2022, 07:17 - Cindy Yang: mm
14/03/2022, 07:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: sounds ideal
14/03/2022, 07:19 - Cindy Yang: it is
14/03/2022, 07:21 - Damien Fung: oh yeah completely unrelated but the car dealership i put a deposit down for has 2 weeks left until the contract expires so if that happens my uncle and i are thinking of getting a different car instead
14/03/2022, 07:21 - Cindy Yang: damn
14/03/2022, 07:21 - Damien Fung: and one of the cars my uncle found for me is a 2nd hand toyota mirai which is apparently a hydrogen fueled car
14/03/2022, 07:21 - Damien Fung: driving that would be p cool but man is that insurance expensive
14/03/2022, 07:22 - Damien Fung: the car itself is somehow relatively cheap tho
14/03/2022, 07:24 - Cindy Yang: waow
14/03/2022, 07:26 - Cindy Yang: oof
14/03/2022, 07:35 - Cindy Yang: the bf has been coming up with hypotheticals like we’ll be passing by some bushes and he’ll be like ‘what if i hurled you into those bushes. what would you do then’
14/03/2022, 07:40 - Damien Fung: and what would you do?
14/03/2022, 07:41 - Cindy Yang: i would simply root myself to the ground and not let him hurl me
14/03/2022, 07:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: powerful
14/03/2022, 07:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yass queen
14/03/2022, 07:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: stand your ground

14/03/2022, 07:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: really pushy hosts, he keeps insisting he has to go and they're like "noooo, you're our guests," asian ppl moment
14/03/2022, 08:00 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
14/03/2022, 08:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: locals are currently clustered around our white man lead excited to see him attempt spicy food, the pan-asian experience
14/03/2022, 08:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I *think* they've removed one of the more sus plotlines
14/03/2022, 08:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: mqn just said "we british have a long tradition of explorign new frontiers"

14/03/2022, 09:25 - Cindy Yang: funny little lad
14/03/2022, 09:25 - Tara: Good taste
14/03/2022, 09:25 - Cindy Yang: mm

14/03/2022, 09:30 - Cindy Yang: wuv?
14/03/2022, 09:30 - Tara: Since apparently the highest level of existence is religious 
Love being endorsed by marriage and God
14/03/2022, 09:32 - Tara: So apparently there was an earthquake in Huizhou and people here felt the tremors
14/03/2022, 09:32 - Tara: My family + Merilyn just slept through it lmao

14/03/2022, 09:33 - Tara: No

14/03/2022, 09:36 - Tara: So if you're struggling to buy something
Buy a philosophy book
14/03/2022, 09:38 - Cindy Yang: lmao nice
14/03/2022, 09:38 - Tara: lmaooo my helper texted the group chat at 230 and then immediately deleted it thinking she was dreaming
14/03/2022, 09:38 - Tara: and rn she's like :O o it was real
14/03/2022, 09:41 - Cindy Yang: lmao wack
14/03/2022, 09:42 - Tara: Can't believe it
My second earthquake and I miss it
14/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
14/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: Ok tbh if I was on campus I may have also slept through it
14/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: / think it's a dream
14/03/2022, 09:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: just realised this is technically a beach episode
14/03/2022, 10:02 - Cindy Yang: wack
14/03/2022, 10:02 - Cindy Yang: do they go to danran beach
14/03/2022, 10:09 - Cindy Yang: u guys remember that icarly episode where she tutors this kid with maths but that kid beats up spencer when she's not there so she tells they created a new number between 6 and 7 called derf or whatever to get him to fail his math test
14/03/2022, 10:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Queen shit
14/03/2022, 10:10 - Tara: How did she convince him omg

14/03/2022, 17:06 - Cindy Yang: yep
14/03/2022, 17:54 - Cindy Yang: wow canvas did a weird thing
14/03/2022, 17:55 - Cindy Yang: it logged me out but i didn't notice cos it still let me stay on my course and i was trying to submit an assignment but there was nowhere to submit it
14/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: oh damn

14/03/2022, 18:06 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
14/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: Did you see the Reddit thread on this
14/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: Ridiculous functions 10/20
14/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: 10/10
14/03/2022, 20:52 - Patsy Ng: saga of i-can't-keep-my-mouth-shut continues

just had a tutorial where we had to discuss the next practical

tutor was like "haskell's easy! you should be able to do the practical in two hours!" which is Not True so I went "yeah that's just cause you have like forty years of haskell experience!"

tutor spluttered and said "I'm not that old!" and then "your grade's now in the single digits" (jesting)

14/03/2022, 22:22 - Sienna Lam: But I would unironically watch that movie
14/03/2022, 22:47 - Cindy Yang: lmao
14/03/2022, 22:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He's just angry Chelsea Manning stole his girl
15/03/2022, 00:32 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/03/2022, 00:52 - Cindy Yang: for someone who went to sleep at 6am and then did not eat breakfast i feel surprisingly okay
15/03/2022, 00:55 - Sienna Lam left
15/03/2022, 00:58 - Patsy Ng: oof why'd sienna leave
15/03/2022, 00:58 - Patsy Ng: also bro eat breakfast
15/03/2022, 01:03 - Cindy Yang: ate
15/03/2022, 01:08 - Patsy Ng: yeay
15/03/2022, 01:13 - Patsy Ng: @12369716003 @14379874097 y'all got any latex tips
15/03/2022, 01:14 - Rishibh Prakash: Are you using overleaf?
15/03/2022, 01:14 - Patsy Ng: just getting started
15/03/2022, 01:14 - Patsy Ng: haven't done anything yet except go on the latex site
15/03/2022, 01:14 - Rishibh Prakash: Ah
15/03/2022, 01:15 - Rishibh Prakash: I would say overleaf is _probably_ a good place to start
15/03/2022, 01:15 - Rishibh Prakash: I'm not the biggest fan of it but I do end up using it quite a bit and it is nice to have everything online so that it's easily accessible
15/03/2022, 01:15 - Patsy Ng: aight i'll have a look
15/03/2022, 01:16 - Patsy Ng: if it makes a difference i primarily want it to format long boolean algebra and truth tables
15/03/2022, 01:16 - Rishibh Prakash: There's probably a package for that?
15/03/2022, 01:16 - Rishibh Prakash: Let me take a look
15/03/2022, 01:17 - Patsy Ng: funko pops thank you
15/03/2022, 01:19 - Rishibh Prakash: Shame it looks tabular (which is how you make normal tables) is your best bet
15/03/2022, 01:19 - Damien Fung: important symbols that aren't as intuitive are /dfrac{}{} and the logical operators
15/03/2022, 01:19 - Patsy Ng: i have the truth tables on excel so i could always just make images out of them
15/03/2022, 01:20 - Damien Fung: most other symbols i found are quite easy to guess
15/03/2022, 01:20 - Rishibh Prakash: Biggest tip is probably to have a single macro file with all your commands that you can just import
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Damien Fung: ^
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Patsy Ng: ?
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Patsy Ng: like symbols to format?
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lol she thought sb kicked her
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Accident
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Rishibh Prakash: But it won't look as good :(
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Damien Fung: i personally really dislike overleaf bc i keep on pressing ctrl + r for some reason
15/03/2022, 01:21 - Damien Fung: yessir
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: or and /cdot
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: oh*
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Patsy Ng: aight
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: also bad for reproducibility!!!
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Sienna Lam joined using this group's invite link
15/03/2022, 01:22 - Patsy Ng: ok i'm gonna go through the latex tutorial and come back when i understand a bit more
15/03/2022, 01:23 - Patsy Ng: wait does latex let you do excel equations in the table cells?
15/03/2022, 01:23 - Patsy Ng: like reproducibility implies you can run stuff in latex?
15/03/2022, 01:23 - Rishibh Prakash: Latex is turing complete, technically you can do anything you want with it
15/03/2022, 01:23 - Damien Fung: ^
15/03/2022, 01:23 - Patsy Ng: oh funsies
15/03/2022, 01:24 - Rishibh Prakash: Much like powerpoint
15/03/2022, 01:24 - Damien Fung: my latex IDE is also R studio so all my computational stuff is integrated with it lol
15/03/2022, 01:24 - Patsy Ng: bro what tell me more
15/03/2022, 01:24 - Rishibh Prakash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8
15/03/2022, 01:25 - Damien Fung: also if you frequently use jupyter you can also integrate latex into that to make some sexy looking code reports
15/03/2022, 01:25 - Damien Fung: eric and i have been struggling a lot with mixing latex with plots for some reason tho
15/03/2022, 01:26 - Rishibh Prakash: also damien are you familiar with https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
15/03/2022, 01:26 - Damien Fung: oh shit that's cool
15/03/2022, 01:31 - Patsy Ng: you are beginning to talk like asimov
15/03/2022, 01:31 - Damien Fung: man i was just thinking about that a while ago
15/03/2022, 01:32 - Patsy Ng: what, you beginning to talk like asimov?
15/03/2022, 01:32 - Damien Fung: i see even more art it maths bc of all the visualization stuff I'm learning
15/03/2022, 01:32 - Damien Fung: like damn pie charts are ugly
15/03/2022, 01:33 - Damien Fung: but area plots are amazing
15/03/2022, 02:01 - Damien Fung: ahhh i can hear geese honking outside again
15/03/2022, 02:15 - Patsy Ng: anyone know how to do ¬ in latex
15/03/2022, 02:15 - Damien Fung: /lnot i think?
15/03/2022, 02:15 - Patsy Ng: yeet thank you
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: wait no
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: /neg
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: ?
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Patsy Ng: no the first one worked
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: oh huh
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Damien Fung: maybe both work
15/03/2022, 02:16 - Patsy Ng: i can try /neg and see if they both work
15/03/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: yeah they both work
15/03/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: idk
15/03/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: i'll stick with /lnot bc /neg makes me think it's gonna be a minus for negative numbers
15/03/2022, 02:22 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
15/03/2022, 04:37 - Patsy Ng: just possibly did the nerdiest thing i've ever done

sent fan(e)mail to the creator of the museum secrets podcast

not even sure if they'll ever get it or reply, it's just In The Void now
15/03/2022, 05:54 - Damien Fung: sitting at the exercise tables at the library
15/03/2022, 05:54 - Damien Fung: cycling while doing assignments is funky
15/03/2022, 05:58 - Patsy Ng: ohhh that sort of exercise
15/03/2022, 05:58 - Patsy Ng: thought you meant tables dedicated for people working on exercise classes
15/03/2022, 06:25 - Patsy Ng: hmm looking at tabular and can you do logical equations in latex

like for excel cells you can do 
= NOT(A1)

is there a latex equivalent?
15/03/2022, 06:34 - Damien Fung: as in have them get computed too?
15/03/2022, 06:34 - Patsy Ng: yeah
15/03/2022, 06:34 - Damien Fung: not sure about overleaf tbh

15/03/2022, 07:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: between the strikes, the covid, and reading week, I have not seen anybody about this subject for over a month
15/03/2022, 07:18 - Patsy Ng: oh oof
15/03/2022, 07:19 - Patsy Ng: can you get an extension
15/03/2022, 07:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I've submitted a form asking about that but the uni still hasn't gotten back to me re: my last application for an extension, which I did *over a week ago* after saying to wait three days
15/03/2022, 07:20 - Patsy Ng: ouch that sucks
15/03/2022, 07:21 - Cindy Yang: o dear
15/03/2022, 07:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Specifically I send the form ten days ago, which was two days after the original deadline. They can only give you a max of a ten day extension from the  original deadline, meaning that even if they decide to read it and decide I have a point re: never having found out about that last assignment for the same reasons but also covid... they would still autofail me because they failed to read it in time
15/03/2022, 07:24 - Patsy Ng: wait are they not doing dual delivery
15/03/2022, 07:24 - Patsy Ng: surely other people also had to isolate in that time, or are studying remotely
15/03/2022, 08:22 - Tara: Hhhh what on earth is that
15/03/2022, 08:23 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
15/03/2022, 08:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: maybe you could code a program to do it
15/03/2022, 08:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: export to csv, read it into Python, write out your thingy in the markup language you need
15/03/2022, 08:23 - Damien Fung: there's probably a IDE or plugin out there for that
15/03/2022, 08:23 - Patsy Ng: yeah but then that means i have to do even more coding
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Patsy Ng: anyway it's only four tables
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Less work than even one table
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Patsy Ng: which i have already done by hand
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just more brainwork
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Patsy Ng: the rest of the prac is equations
15/03/2022, 08:24 - Patsy Ng: anyway we had the option to handwrite i just chose to make my life harder
15/03/2022, 08:25 - Damien Fung: nah it's a good habit
15/03/2022, 08:25 - Damien Fung: bc it's a lot faster once you get the hang of it
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: hrmm
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: yeah
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Damien Fung: and better for work if you need to hand in a report
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: but i could master it another time
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Damien Fung: true
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Damien Fung: but at least you're starting now?
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: cause i have other pracs
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: but also i want my tutor to actually be able to read whatever i write
15/03/2022, 08:26 - Patsy Ng: yee
15/03/2022, 08:28 - Damien Fung: also you can integrate it with markdown so you can make even prettier reports
15/03/2022, 08:30 - Patsy Ng: slow down i'm aiming for legible
15/03/2022, 08:30 - Patsy Ng: but yeah it is very nice
15/03/2022, 08:30 - Patsy Ng: painful tho
15/03/2022, 08:31 - Patsy Ng: anyway i think our specs (the thing that tells us what we have to do for the practicals) are written in latex

they have the same headers
15/03/2022, 08:31 - Damien Fung: i mean it's the same thing but you just put `{language} {code}`
15/03/2022, 08:31 - Cindy Yang: do y’all have any songs to drive the blfkrajrgjh out of my brain
15/03/2022, 08:32 - Patsy Ng: what's the alskdjfalksjd
15/03/2022, 08:32 - Patsy Ng: like do you want hyper or calming or weird or what
15/03/2022, 08:32 - Cindy Yang: hyper i guess
15/03/2022, 08:32 - Damien Fung: everybody circulation
15/03/2022, 08:33 - Patsy Ng: my ordinary life by the living tombstone
15/03/2022, 08:34 - Patsy Ng: also calypso by spiderbait
15/03/2022, 08:35 - Cindy Yang: 👍
15/03/2022, 08:46 - Tara: Play any song on YouTube and increase the playback speed
15/03/2022, 08:47 - Tara: When I want to be efficient I play my Spotify playlist on YouTube and speed it up
15/03/2022, 08:47 - Tara: Because spotify doesn't have this smh
15/03/2022, 08:57 - Rishibh Prakash: https://tableconvert.com/excel-to-latex#:~:text=Use%20%5Cref%7Bmy%2Dlabel,to%20your%20table%20in%20LaTeX.&text=How%20to%20Convert%20Excel%20to%20LaTeX%20Table%20Online%20%3F&text=Just%20paste%20(copy%20tables%20from,the%20magic%20of%20the%20conversion.

Does this work?
15/03/2022, 08:58 - Rishibh Prakash: Never tried it myself but it claims to do what you want
15/03/2022, 08:59 - Rishibh Prakash: Also just had what is by far the worst midterm I've ever done
15/03/2022, 08:59 - Patsy Ng: just gave it a go
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Damien Fung: :(((((
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Rishibh Prakash: The gods will be kind if I get 50%
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: it does alphanumeric stuff ok but it doesn't do logical operators
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Rishibh Prakash: Oof
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: bc it just slaps the character in instead of using latex's slash notation
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Patsy Ng: oof
15/03/2022, 09:00 - Rishibh Prakash: Ah right
15/03/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: but then i guess i could just do a find-replace
15/03/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: oh well too late now
15/03/2022, 09:01 - Patsy Ng: will keep it in mind if i discover i need to change the tables tho
15/03/2022, 09:08 - Tara: Aw bro
15/03/2022, 09:08 - Tara: It's ok you still probably have a final (?)
15/03/2022, 09:08 - Rishibh Prakash: Yes
15/03/2022, 09:08 - Rishibh Prakash: I mean at least I know everybody else found the midterm very difficult as well
15/03/2022, 09:09 - Rishibh Prakash: This prof is just famous for giving difficult tests
15/03/2022, 09:09 - Tara: Good
Low mean
15/03/2022, 09:09 - Rishibh Prakash: And let's just say he lives up to the reputation
15/03/2022, 09:09 - Tara: For your grade
Not your personal satisfaction

15/03/2022, 09:31 - Damien Fung: make it warmer? colder?
15/03/2022, 09:31 - Tanushree Banerjee: idk just make it look better
15/03/2022, 09:32 - Damien Fung: yeah but better's arbitrary

For Mom

April is the cruellest month,
as T.S. Eliot warned.
I disagree - how could it be? -
for it’s when you were born.

Your life before 2002,
I know nothing of,
but my life since is filled with you - 
I’ve known nothing but. 

From my first laugh to my last cry,
you were always present.
Even for my teenage strops, and
all things less than pleasant.

But now I’m grown and far from home, 
we very seldom click,
and when we do, I can’t express
the things that make me tick.

“No secrets between you and me,”
but secrets I’ve aplenty.
There’s some things I just will not share.
Oh, sacred privacy!

Yet though I’ve changed and rearranged, 
there’s one thing that stays true:
no matter when or where I go,
I’ll still come back to you.

18/03/2022, 05:38 - Damien Fung: we asked some grad students for help and they were like "if you apply with a group in mind beforehand it saves profs the effort of reading multiple emails  and/or finding multiple researchers
18/03/2022, 05:38 - Patsy Ng: ah funko pops makes sense
18/03/2022, 06:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Should I name the djungelskog

they mixed up our room numbers so i'm not getting breakfast today

they thought someone else in my flat was isolating as well and left food for them

then they put food outside my door and then they Wouldn't Leave so i couldn't pick it up and then they took it away because i hadn't picked it up (and also because they were like "wait this has Wheat and Meat and we're not sure what this person eats so i guess they don't get to eat"
18/03/2022, 17:41 - Patsy Ng: crisis averted the head serving staff person came up and moved the food from my flatmate's door to mine

also left a note on my door saying i can hear people knock i'd just really rather be sure they were gone before i opened up

19/03/2022, 01:05 - Tara: Hopping is so funny
19/03/2022, 01:05 - Tara: It's like a lil boop
19/03/2022, 01:09 - Patsy Ng: why would she not be allowed to use a while loop
19/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Because the professor said so
19/03/2022, 01:11 - Patsy Ng: yeah but like. what was their rationale
19/03/2022, 01:13 - Tara: Idk
19/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: Ah I remember now
19/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: They hadn't learnt while loops
19/03/2022, 01:16 - Tara: Because obviously they're never taught together
19/03/2022, 01:16 - Tara: And why use while loops for input validation anyway
A truly silly idea
19/03/2022, 01:18 - Tara: Sorry what I meant was
19/03/2022, 01:18 - Tara: They had to create a shopping system
19/03/2022, 01:18 - Tara: With different options - topping up your wallet, buying stuff, seeing the inventory etc
19/03/2022, 01:19 - Tara: Why would you not use a while loop for that
19/03/2022, 01:20 - Patsy Ng: p a i n
19/03/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: clearly they had to use a hashmap to do everything in O(n) /s

19/03/2022, 20:13 - Tara: and i have somehow jumped down the HK education system rabbit hole
19/03/2022, 20:18 - Tara: also what's a use case diagram
19/03/2022, 20:26 - Patsy Ng: which bit is the lie
19/03/2022, 20:27 - Tara: the thing about WIS only accepting people in the zone
19/03/2022, 20:27 - Tara: Do the outlying islands count as being in the zone
19/03/2022, 20:27 - Patsy Ng: yeah it's true
19/03/2022, 20:27 - Tara: That's a very very broad zone
19/03/2022, 20:27 - Patsy Ng: I think there are exceptions like if you move after already being a student or if you come from a feeder school
19/03/2022, 20:28 - Tara: ooh that does make sense
19/03/2022, 20:28 - Tara: not me wondering how the heck martin went to wis
19/03/2022, 20:28 - Patsy Ng: not really

it's more. excluding places on the far side of kowloon, and in the new territories
19/03/2022, 20:29 - Patsy Ng: anyway that's why we had to move when I went to kennedy
19/03/2022, 20:29 - Tara: ah interesting
19/03/2022, 20:35 - Tara: ay i went to make a flowchart and instead of typing lucidchart i searched up litcharts

19/03/2022, 23:07 - Tara: oh man i thought that was hk
19/03/2022, 23:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: smaller island space to the bottom left, long land boi at the bottom, huge mass up top, splitting line top right, red like extending across the middle, absurdly long purple line (vancouver to hefei???)
19/03/2022, 23:07 - Cindy Yang: wow
19/03/2022, 23:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: to a greater degree than most railway maps

19/03/2022, 23:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: africa tho, yikes
19/03/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: thought russia might be underserved but like

- there's a lot of russia but comparatively fewer cities
- a lot of the russian stops are in china
19/03/2022, 23:10 - Tara: what's up with that
19/03/2022, 23:10 - Tara: they really just went nop
19/03/2022, 23:10 - Tara: not connecting these countries
19/03/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i will say that korea has perfectly fine high speed rail and it doesn't really need the integration, but also it's not a serious map so whatever
19/03/2022, 23:11 - Tara: there are two Frankfurt's in this map
19/03/2022, 23:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i saw the book in a bookstore the other day

21/03/2022, 00:15 - Tara: it was an uncomfortable shirt
21/03/2022, 00:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i had a dream where there was music playing in my room
21/03/2022, 00:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: very very loud
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and everybody was telling me to turn it down
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but I couldn't
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I tried turning off my computer and phone and everything
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nothing
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then when I woke up I realised it was just bc I left my music on when I fell asleep
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so it was bleeding into the dream
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: hahaha
21/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: good music though?
21/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: ok yeah it's definitely because it made a weird noise while i was sleeping
21/03/2022, 00:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah it was my playlist

21/03/2022, 03:08 - Cindy Yang: ok wait looks like they’re not banned anymore but they’re not popular
21/03/2022, 03:08 - Cindy Yang: cos it’s been like a century of no blackcurrants
21/03/2022, 03:09 - Patsy Ng: why were they banned
21/03/2022, 03:09 - Damien Fung: was it pests or them being an invasive species?
21/03/2022, 03:10 - Cindy Yang: they were spreading a fungus that waa infecting timber trees

21/03/2022, 16:09 - Tara: ~today~
21/03/2022, 23:14 - Patsy Ng: my life is a sitcom

i thought i was the first person in my family to get covid bc No-One Mentioned Getting It

turns out i'm the last one

mom and father got it two weeks ago and just. didn't tell me until i got it too bc they wanted me to focus on studying

pearl got it an unspecified while ago but before my parents and apparently didn't tell anyone until recently? and i only found out bc mom used it as a point against her while yelling at her for fucking planning a holiday to poland this wednesday
21/03/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lmao
21/03/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm still the first
21/03/2022, 23:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And also the second
21/03/2022, 23:23 - Cindy Yang: inb4 you’re the third
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: tbh I half expect it
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: hhh
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: gotta catch em all (the variants)
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Cindy Yang: why is she planning a vacation to polabd
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Cindy Yang: poland
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Patsy Ng: apparently term was Oh So Difficult so she and her boyfriend are gonna go chill with his grandparents
21/03/2022, 23:24 - Cindy Yang: damn
21/03/2022, 23:25 - Cindy Yang: wow she has boyfriend?
21/03/2022, 23:25 - Patsy Ng: new since christmas
21/03/2022, 23:26 - Cindy Yang: also oop was about to buy a drink and a burrito at the cafe but i was like wait i don’t know how much school food money i have on my account so i only got the burrito which is good cos after that i only had 1 dollar lefy
21/03/2022, 23:26 - Cindy Yang: nice
21/03/2022, 23:26 - Patsy Ng: f

is it a thing you top up or are you out of school food money for the month
21/03/2022, 23:27 - Cindy Yang: yea i can top up
21/03/2022, 23:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean she goes to cbridge right
21/03/2022, 23:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so it probably was oh so difficult
21/03/2022, 23:28 - Patsy Ng: yeah but if you go to cambridge you also already function at cambridge level

so it'd be oh so difficult objectively but subjectively it would be difficult
21/03/2022, 23:29 - Cindy Yang: i suppose
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Eh
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Doubt
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There's a reason they need such short terms and long holidays
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's absolutely brutal over there
21/03/2022, 23:30 - Patsy Ng: also i was going for the "isn't it kind of bad taste to be holidaying in a country currently struggling to handle a mega influx of refugees" angle rather than "your term couldn't possibly have been difficult" angle
21/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: that's fair but you could have just said that
21/03/2022, 23:31 - Patsy Ng: but so many words
21/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't approve of vacationing in Poland anyway because their government is mega homophobic
21/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but it's not like she can ask her bf's grandparents to move
21/03/2022, 23:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: not arguing just ehhh
21/03/2022, 23:37 - Patsy Ng: yeah i get what you mean
21/03/2022, 23:38 - Patsy Ng: anyway yeah i think i was just trying to explain it the way she said it

like "my term's just been really difficult so i need this"
21/03/2022, 23:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lmaooooo
21/03/2022, 23:41 - Tara: and here i thought y'all were on about covid

21/03/2022, 23:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because if I had somehow been the perfect child for a few years
21/03/2022, 23:45 - Tara: do yall not get work
21/03/2022, 23:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would have gone someplace a lot more difficult than here and I would have been 17 at the start
21/03/2022, 23:45 - Tara: o
21/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: also I developed half my personality in my gap year & spent it reconnecting with my culture and all that
21/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
21/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would have been *extremely* poorly equipped to deal with living alone at 17
21/03/2022, 23:52 - Cindy Yang: yea but the oxford ppl are like idk writing three 1000 word essays every week
21/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: yuck

22/03/2022, 18:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh yeah

22/03/2022, 18:31 - Tara: Honf Konf
22/03/2022, 18:32 - Tara: The aunties are so judgemental and competitive
22/03/2022, 18:34 - Tara: Example
Be my birthday
Get a call from one aunty (dip's mom because she's nice) to wish me hbd
Then later another aunty calls (very annoying aunty) to wish me hbd
Then according to mother that aunty B goes on the GC and goes oh yah guys remember to wish [me] hbd but haha I did it first suck it bitches
22/03/2022, 18:35 - Tara: Paraphrased
22/03/2022, 18:35 - Patsy Ng: wait they have an aunty gc?
22/03/2022, 18:35 - Tara: Also you know the jokes about parents comparing their kids
22/03/2022, 18:35 - Tara: That was aunty B with her daughter and my sister
22/03/2022, 18:36 - Tara: Ya
22/03/2022, 18:36 - Tara: The South horizons shipping gang

22/03/2022, 18:36 - Tara: No it's dumb lemme give you a snippet of what it looks like
22/03/2022, 18:37 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 18:37 - Tara: The conspiracy theories
22/03/2022, 18:37 - Tara: The racism
22/03/2022, 18:37 - Tara: Ok not racism
22/03/2022, 18:38 - Tara: Das a family thing
22/03/2022, 18:38 - Tara: Also saw the red flags and thought huh who got divorced
22/03/2022, 18:39 - Tara: Good luck
22/03/2022, 18:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: still better than carrie lam
22/03/2022, 18:41 - Patsy Ng: sometimes i feel bad about not being on any extended family gcs or even like. any contact points for my cousins

but that goes away whenever you send screenshots of your fam gc
22/03/2022, 18:41 - Tara: Oh dw we have a cousin's chat too
22/03/2022, 18:41 - Tara: Those guys I like
22/03/2022, 18:41 - Patsy Ng: mm
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: i think i'm probably. closer to a weird cat that sometimes turns up for food (family gatherings)
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Tara: Befriend the weird cat
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: hiss
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Tara: Kidnap it

22/03/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: oh
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Tara: And raise it as your child
22/03/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: i'm the weird cat
22/03/2022, 18:43 - Tara: Oh

22/03/2022, 18:43 - Tara: Not a
22/03/2022, 18:43 - Patsy Ng: as in. i'm probably more like a hypothetical cat than a cousin
22/03/2022, 18:43 - Tara: It's so humid help
22/03/2022, 18:43 - Tara: I gotta go home
22/03/2022, 18:44 - Tara: Cannot handle this
22/03/2022, 18:44 - Tara: It's so gloomy and the rainstorm warning keeps getting cancelled
22/03/2022, 18:44 - Tara: Like just let it out girl so I can enjoy spring
22/03/2022, 18:47 - Patsy Ng: are in dorms rn

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14YknyrG53taWuE_XAk93qj8VtBUuP68m9CwsnOqx7Bw/edit?usp=sharing
23/03/2022, 00:06 - Damien Fung: i'll check after lecture
23/03/2022, 00:06 - Damien Fung: also are you heading back in summer?
23/03/2022, 00:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lo tinggggg
23/03/2022, 00:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Do you think you might end up a museum worker
23/03/2022, 00:13 - Patsy Ng: i would say yes from looking at just. the life choices i have made, but anything contractual that is more curatorial / archival than databasey requires a museum studies degree, which i am not doing
23/03/2022, 00:13 - Patsy Ng: yee
23/03/2022, 00:13 - Patsy Ng: thank
23/03/2022, 00:14 - Cindy Yang: noice
23/03/2022, 00:14 - Patsy Ng: anyway in an ideal world where i have loads of cash i think after i do my compsci degree i'd like to do a museum studies degree
23/03/2022, 00:16 - Patsy Ng: also it refers to an internship specification which is Nowhere To Be Found, so i emailed and asked for it an apparently they've done away with it so it's based on Vibes now i guess
23/03/2022, 00:17 - Damien Fung: oooo how long are you staying for?
23/03/2022, 00:19 - Patsy Ng: depends on when we can book a flight

but my last (and only) exam is on april 29, and i get kicked out of dorms on may 21, so
23/03/2022, 00:19 - Patsy Ng: large time diff is bc my exam is relatively early in the exam period
23/03/2022, 00:19 - Damien Fung: noice
23/03/2022, 00:20 - Damien Fung: i'm trying to rebook my flight rn but cathay's taking ages to move help me out bc everyone's also trying to rebook their flights
23/03/2022, 00:20 - Patsy Ng: when are you aiming for
23/03/2022, 00:20 - Damien Fung: as early in may as possible
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Damien Fung: finish exams on 26th and end lease on 30th
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Damien Fung: of april*
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Patsy Ng: wait i thought your apartment was permanent
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Patsy Ng: as like
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Damien Fung: yeah but i'm moving back to my family home to save money
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Patsy Ng: a place for you + fam to overspill into when everyone's there
23/03/2022, 00:21 - Damien Fung: and so i can afford a car
23/03/2022, 00:22 - Patsy Ng: wait so you're selling the apartment for a car?
23/03/2022, 00:22 - Damien Fung: nah i'm just renting this
23/03/2022, 00:22 - Damien Fung: it's just that 12 months is the sweet spot since they gave me 1 month free rent as a signing bonus and i need to complete the 12th month to get the 1 month free
23/03/2022, 00:24 - Patsy Ng: fun
23/03/2022, 00:24 - Damien Fung: but yeah once i get a car living here isn't really worth it since i can do a lot more in the middle of vancouver with a car
23/03/2022, 00:28 - Damien Fung: also y'all who are coming back/are already there do y'all wanna go camping or hiking bc meri and i are trying to think of camps/hikes to do
23/03/2022, 00:28 - Patsy Ng: didn't we have bridespool down on the bucket list
23/03/2022, 00:29 - Damien Fung: oh yeah good idea
23/03/2022, 00:29 - Damien Fung: OH WE CAN FINALLY DO THE BUCKET LIST
23/03/2022, 00:29 - Patsy Ng: can't recall campsites near it off the top of my head but it's connected to a bunch of trails so the worst is it has to be a hiking camp
23/03/2022, 00:30 - Patsy Ng: we're gonna have a kind of narrow window to do everything tho bc of quarantining reqs
23/03/2022, 00:30 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah @12369716003 how's your covidtine going
23/03/2022, 00:30 - Damien Fung: oh i'm gonna be there for like 3 months so dw about that
23/03/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: i ordered a camera flash. it arrived. delivery guy did not buzz my unit. it's in the lobby.
23/03/2022, 00:31 - Cindy Yang: oof
23/03/2022, 00:31 - Patsy Ng: were you planning to do indoor photography with the flash?
23/03/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: well
23/03/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: you know how i was taking photos on a boat
23/03/2022, 00:32 - Damien Fung: i took 300 shots
23/03/2022, 00:32 - Damien Fung: 75% of which i took hoping they would be salvageable in post
23/03/2022, 00:32 - Damien Fung: 25% i took with good lighting
23/03/2022, 00:33 - Damien Fung: i ended up with 52 shots after editing
23/03/2022, 00:33 - Damien Fung: most of which were from here
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Damien Fung: i will never do event photography without a flash again
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Cindy Yang: wack
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Patsy Ng: oof
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Patsy Ng: i thought most cameras came with a flash tho
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Patsy Ng: maybe not a good one, but onr
23/03/2022, 00:34 - Patsy Ng: *one
23/03/2022, 00:35 - Damien Fung: yeah but as you go up the chain of professional cameras they get rid of internal flashes since every professional photographer who needs a flash probably already has a better one in their kit
23/03/2022, 00:35 - Patsy Ng: wacko
23/03/2022, 00:38 - Damien Fung: also i'm super excited to get out of quarantine bc it's cherry blossom season rn and i think it's gonna peak real soon
23/03/2022, 00:38 - Damien Fung: think i found the perfect street to use my fancy lens on
23/03/2022, 00:38 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah

i realized that the spring equinox was yesterday so we just. missed that

which is Weird
23/03/2022, 00:39 - Damien Fung: yep.
23/03/2022, 00:45 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah if martini's coming back there's like. the lantau waterfall or sth near silvermine bay

there's a trail going from it to pui o and it's doable in a few hours so we could do sth like. meet at the piers, go to the waterfall, then hike to martini's house
23/03/2022, 00:52 - Cindy Yang: nicee
23/03/2022, 00:52 - Cindy Yang: lmao subway surfers current theme is vancouver and there are a lotta cherry blossoms

23/03/2022, 01:20 - Cindy Yang: how are y’alls families doing with covid
23/03/2022, 01:21 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>

23/03/2022, 07:23 - Patsy Ng: why are you reading that page in french
23/03/2022, 07:23 - Damien Fung: b r u h i ordered groceries from walmart and i'm completely out of eggs but for some reason walmart also doesn't have any eggs so now i'm stuck without eggs :(
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Patsy Ng: oof
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because wrens being called "cute cave dweller" in french is adorable
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Patsy Ng: hey you know that thing where you can substitute an egg for like. three tablespoons of blood or sth
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's even more silly tthan the latin "cave dweller cave dweller"
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no?
23/03/2022, 07:24 - Damien Fung: you can sub in egg yolks with olive oil i think
23/03/2022, 07:25 - Damien Fung: but only for the fat
23/03/2022, 07:25 - Damien Fung: not for the texture or flavour ofc
23/03/2022, 07:25 - Patsy Ng: yeah the blood thing is only if you want the egg to stick other things together
23/03/2022, 07:51 - Cindy Yang: wat
23/03/2022, 12:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oomf posted a link to an article about a remote island pedo sex cult and like
23/03/2022, 12:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I clicked it because I was bored and it's 4am
23/03/2022, 12:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And immediately bam, the first sentence: "November 14, 2002"
23/03/2022, 12:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Specifically the article was about how the island was so remote and so sex culty that when the British govt tried to prosecute them they were like "nooooo don't prosecute ppl for pedo crimes, that would require you to take the majority of our population to court and we would die out"
23/03/2022, 12:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which
23/03/2022, 12:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What
23/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: oh yeahhh i remember hearing about it
23/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: actually it might have been another pedo ring
23/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: but there was an island
23/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: and a bunch of boys
23/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: and no one was prosecuted
23/03/2022, 12:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they were like noooo it's our local cultureeee and like... no you are white settlers stfu
23/03/2022, 12:31 - Tara: they're also pedo's
23/03/2022, 13:29 - Tara: boggles my mind how there's a massive railway statuary body in india
23/03/2022, 13:29 - Tara: like they have their own hospitals and all
23/03/2022, 13:29 - Tara: my aunt used to work in one of their hospitals in nagpur
23/03/2022, 13:29 - Tara: like damn
23/03/2022, 13:30 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 13:32 - Tara: lmao HK is only 127th in the world when it comes to the size of our railway
23/03/2022, 13:33 - Tara: oh nvm 127/147
23/03/2022, 13:33 - Tara: i can now see why isaac is obsessed with trains
23/03/2022, 13:34 - Tara: hmm Chhattisgarh doesn't have anything in the south
23/03/2022, 13:34 - Tara: And there's nothing in Sikkim?
23/03/2022, 13:34 - Tara: ok bye
23/03/2022, 17:14 - Patsy Ng: got haggis for breakfast :(
23/03/2022, 17:18 - Tara: Bro what is your uni doing
23/03/2022, 17:18 - Tara: Are you gonna complain
23/03/2022, 17:19 - Patsy Ng: no
23/03/2022, 17:19 - Patsy Ng: i have enough snacks (also from them) to just. not eat the beef stuff
23/03/2022, 17:21 - Patsy Ng: they're generally pretty good, they email people in quarantine like every two days to make sure they're not dead

i think the kitchen staff are just. overworked

either that or they don't care

bc the accomodation contract says they don't do no-beef diets (but the religious version, i can't remember what it's called), so i assumed they'd bump it up to vegetarian rather than bump it down to no restrictions
23/03/2022, 17:21 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: HIBISCUS

24/03/2022, 01:06 - Tara: His stick limbs
24/03/2022, 01:07 - Patsy Ng: the satanic iconography
24/03/2022, 01:07 - Tara: The clash between the background and his god damn clothes
24/03/2022, 01:08 - Patsy Ng: the british last names despite it being set mostly in switzerland
24/03/2022, 05:15 - Cindy Yang: sheesh the room next door is just blasting music rn
24/03/2022, 05:16 - Damien Fung: o o f
24/03/2022, 05:17 - Cindy Yang: looks like the room insulation is pretty decent tho cos i’m hearing most of it coming out their door and through my door rather than through the walls

24/03/2022, 05:18 - Damien Fung: back in my dorm the walls were super thin so i could hear people having sex every other night

24/03/2022, 09:44 - Tara: Yay
24/03/2022, 10:11 - Tara: How did they manage to put complex numbers into circuits
24/03/2022, 10:13 - Tara: Me when they introduce wackier maths into circuits fully knowing that engineering is maths heavy
24/03/2022, 10:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
24/03/2022, 10:36 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>

24/03/2022, 17:27 - Damien Fung: so some of warcus and kai's friends from Southampton joined the discord server i hop on often and they managed to guess I'm canadian which means i have become even more canadian now
24/03/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: *more* Canadian?
24/03/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: This message was deleted
24/03/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: before i was just canadian born

24/03/2022, 17:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no the random line break was funny
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Patsy Ng: ohhh the accent???
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: shhhh
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Patsy Ng: bro we have to get on a discord call when you're actually awake
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: i should sleep
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "you merely acquired the cold, I was born in it"
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: molded by it
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: hey in my defense last time we all called it was 6am for me
24/03/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: as you can see my sleep schedule isn't the best
24/03/2022, 17:33 - Patsy Ng: yeah ik

24/03/2022, 17:33 - Patsy Ng: true
24/03/2022, 17:34 - Damien Fung: even warcus used me as an example for a subtle canadian accent ;-;

25/03/2022, 00:23 - Cindy Yang: nice
25/03/2022, 10:26 - Cindy Yang: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa my laptop won’t start properly
25/03/2022, 10:26 - Patsy Ng: oof
25/03/2022, 10:26 - Patsy Ng: take out battery and put it back in?
25/03/2022, 10:34 - Cindy Yang: what will that do to my laptop
25/03/2022, 10:35 - Patsy Ng: should shut it down

might complain and boot up the "laptop didn't shut down properly" thing but then you run the recovery option and hopefully it works
25/03/2022, 10:35 - Damien Fung: man i forgot that's an option nowadays
25/03/2022, 10:35 - Damien Fung: Haven't seen a removable battery in years
25/03/2022, 10:37 - Cindy Yang: hmm maybe i’ll just take it to tech support
25/03/2022, 10:38 - Cindy Yang: also yea i have no clue if that’s possible
25/03/2022, 10:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 10:41 - Cindy Yang: lmao
25/03/2022, 10:42 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 10:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Honestly idk either
25/03/2022, 10:45 - Patsy Ng: factory images means all your data gets wiped
25/03/2022, 10:45 - Patsy Ng: as in it goes back to factory settings
25/03/2022, 10:46 - Cindy Yang: yea i figured so

25/03/2022, 12:46 - Cindy Yang: nice
25/03/2022, 18:52 - Tara: I can't believe Cameron's sister in modern family is Pameron
25/03/2022, 18:52 - Tara: Called*
25/03/2022, 19:03 - Patsy Ng: you know how you can reconstruct people's fingerprints if they take decent quality photos and their fingerpads are in frame

and how that makes it. easier to commit identity theft

do you think the people whose hands are used in movie closeups ever think about that
25/03/2022, 19:18 - Tara: Interesting question
25/03/2022, 19:19 - Tara: Honestly idk I never thought that was an option
25/03/2022, 19:23 - Patsy Ng: it's really hard and it depends on the image quality so it's not. common

but it is possible
25/03/2022, 20:12 - Patsy Ng: aight i have written a smallish answer to the last question for the museum internship application

may i have proofreaders please

26/03/2022, 00:21 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
26/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Whenever I play the Witcher I have my sword next to me and occasionally neigh
26/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Just so I can really be immersed in the game
26/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: Like Geralt I too hate portals
26/03/2022, 00:36 - Patsy Ng: ... you neigh? to feel like geralt? i clearly missed sth when we watched the first few episodes for media night
26/03/2022, 00:40 - Tara: He has a horse called Roach
26/03/2022, 00:40 - Patsy Ng: i know he has a horse but i didn't think he neighed to the horse
26/03/2022, 00:41 - Tara: Oh no it's more like it adds to the environment™️
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: ah funko pops
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: you could google horse sounds on youtube and put it on loop
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: sometimes i do that with cow or pigeon noises
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Tara: For fun or while you're studying?
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Tara: Or both
26/03/2022, 00:42 - Patsy Ng: when i just feel like it
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Ah
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Are they soothing noises
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Patsy Ng: yes
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Dunno why I asked that
I forget that HK also has pidgeons
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Oh btw how are you feeling
26/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Are you still in quarantine
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Patsy Ng: the cow moos were the soundtrack to my mornings in the first plague year while doing the crossword
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Patsy Ng: day nine
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Tara: One of my friends told us she has covid but the way she said it was very nonchalant it was kinda funny
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Patsy Ng: last quarantine day tomorrow
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Patsy Ng: bruh?
26/03/2022, 00:44 - Tara: Damn

26/03/2022, 00:45 - Patsy Ng: matey you can't just leave it at that you have to tell the story
26/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Oh I'm finding the conversation
26/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Uh so when this girl Siyoon talks she has a lot of pauses
26/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: And anyways her voice is kinda soothing
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: And whenever she has news her tone doesn't change at all
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: wow the tone
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: So reading this was like
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Hilarious
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: So casual
26/03/2022, 00:47 - Patsy Ng: not a fullstop, not an ellipse, something in between
26/03/2022, 00:48 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/03/2022, 00:49 - Tara: She never came back smh I haven't seen her since January
26/03/2022, 00:49 - Patsy Ng: at least this one has exclamation marks
26/03/2022, 00:49 - Patsy Ng: ah.
26/03/2022, 00:49 - Tara: Dw she hasn't dropped out yet
26/03/2022, 00:49 - Patsy Ng: so did she catch covid in korea or is it fifth wave and you just haven't seen her
26/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: In Korea
26/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: Damn I miss her face

26/03/2022, 00:51 - Tara: Efje is throwing le bday party tomorrow but I cannot go because I've got midterms and also lmao people can't meet idk why she's doing it now
26/03/2022, 00:52 - Patsy Ng: hhh do it over a club penguin backup
26/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: Oh we will be discording
26/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: To play games hopefully
26/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: But ugh restrictions are gonna loosen up in April just celebrate then
26/03/2022, 00:53 - Patsy Ng: background: my parents never threw me a birthday party till i turned 18 so in year 5 like. meri, john, yoyo, and eunice were like "ok we'll have a party on club penguin in eunice's den!"
26/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: Wow
1. Was it fun
2. Was your first bday party really the one you had in the hotel
26/03/2022, 00:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lm ao
26/03/2022, 00:54 - Tara: Also what's a den I've never played club penguin
26/03/2022, 00:54 - Tara: Huh what did you do the year after
26/03/2022, 00:54 - Patsy Ng: 1. yes, but more for the sentiment than for the implementation
2. yes
26/03/2022, 00:54 - Tara: Oh wait you went to Ocean park right
26/03/2022, 00:55 - Tara: Oh jeez you're almost 20
26/03/2022, 00:56 - Tara: I'm not missing anyone's bday right
26/03/2022, 00:56 - Tara: Brb
26/03/2022, 00:56 - Patsy Ng: i forgot to get a ticket so they were out bc covid meant less capacity

so i walked to the base of a mountain in the rain while thinking about climbing it and deciding not to because of the beware of death signs
26/03/2022, 00:56 - Patsy Ng: then i went home and had tea and watched a documentary called "how to survive a plague"
26/03/2022, 00:57 - Tara: Any tips?
26/03/2022, 00:57 - Patsy Ng: oh wait ii got it wrong the term is igloo

it's like. where your penguin lives

it holds your furniture and your puffles (pets)
26/03/2022, 00:57 - Tara: Ohh
26/03/2022, 00:57 - Tara: Puffles
Sounds adorable
26/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: Ooh sister made banana bread today
It's delicious and I want more of it
26/03/2022, 00:58 - Patsy Ng: the plague in question is not the current one

it's about the aids epidemic and how they found a treatment
26/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: How did they do that
26/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: Ah I'll just read up on it
26/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: It's 1am I'm going to sleep
Goodnight
26/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: Good talk
26/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: Also random thing you have the same bday as Yasath my kcl friend
26/03/2022, 01:00 - Patsy Ng: they had a ton of meetings

it was basically citizen science bc the (american) govt was actively Not Helping (the doc's usa-centric)

so like. phd people would work on stuff in their spare time and people with aids would volunteer to try stuff out and they'd all get really good at reading stuff in medical journals bc they were always on the lookout for new discoveries that might help
26/03/2022, 01:00 - Patsy Ng: why do you keep finding twins for us
26/03/2022, 01:00 - Patsy Ng: actually scratch that

not "why" but "how"
26/03/2022, 01:01 - Tara: I am a friendship matchmaker
26/03/2022, 01:02 - Tara: Even though my success rate is not that high
People become friends and then it either fizzles out or ends terribly
26/03/2022, 01:02 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
26/03/2022, 01:02 - Tara: Lmao I'm being dramatic it's only happened twice
26/03/2022, 01:03 - Tara: Wow that's nice but also damn the USA government what were they thinking
26/03/2022, 01:03 - Patsy Ng: yuen yin and i bonded over murder during the christmas hols and then it fizzled out
26/03/2022, 01:03 - Tara: Ok nvm it's happened a few times then
26/03/2022, 01:03 - Tara: I'm good at matching people's vibes
26/03/2022, 01:04 - Tara: Whether or not it proceeds with actual friendship is not my business
26/03/2022, 01:04 - Tara: Ooh actually Sandeepti is a better matchmaker than I am smh I'm jealous
26/03/2022, 01:06 - Patsy Ng: you know how the six degrees of separation thing only happens bc there's certain people who know everyone

like that psych experiment where they got people to send a parcel to a rando on the other side of the world before the age of social media so people had to just. send the parcel to someone they knew and hope that they could get the parcel closer

when the parcels arrived, the researchers found that there were a couple people who were on all the parcels
26/03/2022, 01:06 - Tara: She befriended Yuen Yin because they were in the same interview and thought hey she looks cool
Then after an elec1100 class she chatted to siyoon for a minute and bam we're friends
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Tara: Oh huh it's actually 6 degrees? I saw it in a lecture slide briefly and assumed it was just an example
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Tara: That's cool!
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Patsy Ng: it's not always six degrees
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Tara: Reminds me of Markov chains
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Patsy Ng: it's just. the common one people say i guess
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Tara: And also LinkedIn!
26/03/2022, 01:07 - Patsy Ng: pain
26/03/2022, 01:08 - Tara: That's so cool though
What was their success rate
26/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: I gotta stop talking to you at 12 because then I simply do not sleep
26/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: I will read the Wikipedia page tomorrow
26/03/2022, 01:09 - Patsy Ng: presumably high? the only way the researchers could know who the parcels had been sent to was from the parcels themselves, bc the names and addresses were written on the parcels
26/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: That and AIDS
26/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: So cool
26/03/2022, 01:10 - Patsy Ng: aight good night i can hear the exhaustion
26/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Yes goodnight
26/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Ttyl
26/03/2022, 01:11 - Tara: /g just in case

26/03/2022, 02:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: he has his arm over her and she's just sittin
26/03/2022, 03:05 - Patsy Ng: none of you do the nyt letter boxed so i would just like to say that i made the word "zirconium" today
26/03/2022, 03:06 - Cindy Yang: noice
26/03/2022, 03:06 - Cindy Yang: what is that
26/03/2022, 03:06 - Cindy Yang: letter boxed
26/03/2022, 03:08 - Patsy Ng: there's a square with three letters on each side and you have to use all the letters in words within a certain number of words

but each letter can only be followed by a letter that isn't on the side it's on
26/03/2022, 03:18 - Cindy Yang: i see
26/03/2022, 03:39 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>

26/03/2022, 11:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: mostly to see y'all but also to see my parents I guess
26/03/2022, 11:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And also because I want to buy a Japanese water boiler compatible with UK voltage and you can't get much foreign shit in the UK
26/03/2022, 11:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which means either waiting for the one import vendor that stocks them to restock, or coming home, going to Fortress, and rice-cookering it all the way to Wales
26/03/2022, 12:08 - Tara: Oh Christ I went to check my midterm grade and saw 0/100 which was scary
Then realised they hadn't actually marked it
26/03/2022, 12:09 - Damien Fung: yeah happened to me twice already

27/03/2022, 03:16 - Damien Fung: yeah it's a really cool system
27/03/2022, 03:16 - Damien Fung: it's called an amber alert bc a girl called amber was kidnapped and found dead or smth and it could've been prevented if a system like this was in place
27/03/2022, 03:17 - Damien Fung: https://youtu.be/TP2LMrUN8Dk

27/03/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: are there just. tons of ads for it everywhere
27/03/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: or are you supposed to find out about it through osmosis
27/03/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: like obvs you just sent an ad but like. i can't imagine many people now watch enough satellite tv or don't have adblock to see it
27/03/2022, 03:23 - Damien Fung: first through the vid then forgot about it and realized they have it here in canada when i got one last year
27/03/2022, 03:23 - Patsy Ng: wait it made it look like you have to sign up for it
27/03/2022, 03:24 - Patsy Ng: like it's an app or sth
27/03/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: like i think nowadays it's just directly connected to your service provider
27/03/2022, 03:24 - Patsy Ng: is it just an sms thing?
27/03/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: nah you know how a few years ago someone in the US gov pressed a button and it seemed like Hawaii was gonna be nuked bc everyone there got an alarm?
27/03/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: same system

28/03/2022, 23:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lmao
28/03/2022, 23:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: - turned in my second piece of extenuating circumstances work today
- finally got a response about my first piece of work I asked about *23 days on* unprompted which was like "Hi Martin, we're sorry you've not received a response, can you submit it right now?"
28/03/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I had to reply explaining that I can't because I've been prioritising work that I know *can* be submitted, and that I'll go back to working on it if I can be provided with an actual due date
28/03/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because this is ridiculous
28/03/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like
28/03/2022, 23:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 23 actual days is not three business days
28/03/2022, 23:26 - Patsy Ng: oof
28/03/2022, 23:27 - Patsy Ng: are you more stressed or annoyed
28/03/2022, 23:27 - Patsy Ng: or neither
28/03/2022, 23:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm really annoyed
28/03/2022, 23:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: at this point I am fully willing to take the 0 because I can still pass and this has been an issue for too long
28/03/2022, 23:28 - Patsy Ng: wacko
28/03/2022, 23:28 - Patsy Ng: hopefully you won't have to take the 0 tho
28/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the audacity of making me wait 23 days
28/03/2022, 23:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ignorign the emails where I asked
28/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and responding to other emails asking about other things where I also asked about this, but answering all my questions other than the ones about this
28/03/2022, 23:31 - Patsy Ng: can you go talk to them in person? like during office hours or sth
28/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then suddenly out of the blue emailing me like "hi student i forgor 💀 can you give me the work right now"
28/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nah because this isn't an interaction with a teacher this is with the extenuating circumstances people
28/03/2022, 23:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the actual teachers don't give a shit
28/03/2022, 23:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the actual teachers have been like "yeah this is ridiculous hope you still pass"
28/03/2022, 23:32 - Patsy Ng: wait are your extenuating circumstances people not lecturers

for us they have that job on top of lecturing and tutoring and whatever
28/03/2022, 23:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: too busy having admin freaks attempt to cut their wages and halve their pensions
28/03/2022, 23:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no that's handled by administrators employed by the faculty I believe
28/03/2022, 23:33 - Patsy Ng: ah
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Oh my goddd that's so annoying
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Why are they dragging their feey
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Feet
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the audacity of actively ignoring this one specific task for 23 days, to the point of selectively not reading 50% of my emails (not like 50% of emails are unread, as in they responded to most of my emails but only the 50% of each one)
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then contacting me when I've already given up
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Can you complain to someone
28/03/2022, 23:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "oh actually I have decided I do want the work can you give it to me *now*"
28/03/2022, 23:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no it's somebody doing their job
28/03/2022, 23:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: if I get a proper deadline idgaf
28/03/2022, 23:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's just
28/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: Not that well?
28/03/2022, 23:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's probably like a shared inbox so I can't complain about anybody in particular?
28/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: There's gotta be someone
Ugh that's so annoying
28/03/2022, 23:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: anyway, yesterday I decided I wasn't going to sign up to do a CELTA language teaching course because while I would benefit a lot from it and it's a lot cheaper thorugh the uni:
- at any moment something ridiculous like this could happen and another month of my life could be ruined again, so I can't sign up to anything intensive
- If I am too busy now, an entire month after covid, dealing with the fallout of covid, to even work out the stupid application, I am certainly too busy to actually do the intensive course
- the application is on a website thingy and they want me to fill in my most recent qualification and i am still sore about the IB
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Patsy Ng: sounds rough
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Tara: What's celta
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's a cert for language teaching and supposedly doing the course basically takes over your life for six weeks
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Patsy Ng: also do you have/did you have covid fatigue? bit confused on that point
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Tara: Oh ok
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Tara: What language
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I am still vaguely fatigued but that's because I go to bed at 4am
28/03/2022, 23:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: english
28/03/2022, 23:52 - Patsy Ng: ah wacko

good that it's not like. long covid fatigue but also. go to bed at a Good Time
28/03/2022, 23:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like, there's no point in signing up for celta if one coviddy boi can derail my entire life to the extent that it did at the beginning of march, because I am *still* dealing with the administrative fallout
28/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: Would the school not accept a transcript
28/03/2022, 23:53 - Tara: Ok yeah fair
28/03/2022, 23:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: if I get to submit my own CV and cover letter for things, I usually get them because I'm an amazing candidate in my own right

if i have to submit my IB scores for something I am rather worried that I will not get that thing, because my IB scores are not at all reflective of my skills
28/03/2022, 23:58 - Tara: Oh so there's nothing else to it? Just IB
28/03/2022, 23:58 - Tara: That's weird
29/03/2022, 00:01 - Patsy Ng: wait @447380604852 does swansea have like. sp coding
29/03/2022, 00:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They want my most recent qualification
29/03/2022, 00:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is the IB
29/03/2022, 00:02 - Patsy Ng: that thing where you pick modules on your transcript and get to say "this grade is a lot lower than it should have been due to the pandemic"
29/03/2022, 00:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So I will simply not apply for this extra course
29/03/2022, 00:03 - Tara: What's sp
29/03/2022, 00:04 - Patsy Ng: can't remember what it stands for but this
29/03/2022, 00:04 - Patsy Ng: anyway gonna go try go for a run so I'll be back in half an hourish
29/03/2022, 00:04 - Tara: Ok goodnight
29/03/2022, 00:51 - Cindy Yang: big yikes

29/03/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Small goals that they care a lot about
29/03/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, you want covid to drop not for covid dropping's sake, but for granola
29/03/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I want a disposable income to specifically buy a water boiler
29/03/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Etc etc
29/03/2022, 10:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just like, minor dreams that aren't massively out of reach that people want a reasonable amount
29/03/2022, 10:20 - Tara: yes it's so nice
29/03/2022, 10:20 - Tara: i wanna make granola

29/03/2022, 15:48 - Tara: visiting a professor's wikipedia page and seeing who their thesis adviser was
29/03/2022, 15:48 - Tara: then finding their adviser's adviser
29/03/2022, 15:48 - Tara: until you find the original thesis adviser
29/03/2022, 15:58 - Tara: sucshesh
29/03/2022, 15:58 - Tara: so i was trying to find this TA who I mildly despise because his handwriting is shit

29/03/2022, 15:58 - Tara: Pan Hui's ancestor-adviser is Nathaniel Bowditch
29/03/2022, 15:59 - Tara: 1773-1838
29/03/2022, 15:59 - Tara: 10 generations
29/03/2022, 15:59 - Tara: i know there's one for mathematicians
29/03/2022, 16:02 - Patsy Ng: wouldn't nathaniel bowditch have had an adviser too tho
29/03/2022, 16:02 - Tara: probably
29/03/2022, 16:02 - Tara: but it's not on his page
29/03/2022, 16:03 - Tara: le gasp he's in the maths tree
29/03/2022, 16:05 - Tara: oh nay i got to pan hui's advisor bu ti cannot find him in the tree
29/03/2022, 16:05 - Tara: stupid computer science
29/03/2022, 16:19 - Patsy Ng: photos from morning walks

starts off with plants but then is just. filled with swans

29/03/2022, 16:20 - Tara: wow they're pretty
29/03/2022, 18:09 - Patsy Ng: just spent the last hour installing python packages and honestly that just about sums up the python experience
29/03/2022, 18:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, I install them infrequently enough that I need to Google the pip command
29/03/2022, 18:15 - Patsy Ng: mm
29/03/2022, 18:15 - Patsy Ng: i would also have that experience
29/03/2022, 18:15 - Tara: damn yall
29/03/2022, 18:16 - Tara: turns out i didnt even have pip installed until january
29/03/2022, 18:16 - Tara: im a good developer
29/03/2022, 18:16 - Patsy Ng: but i need to run python on the uni's lab pcs, and for some bizarre and annoying reason, if you go long enough without using that specific pc, it uninstalls all your packages
29/03/2022, 18:16 - Tara: im gonna blame it on me coding more in C/C++
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: i hate c
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Tara: it's terrible!
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: how do you do it
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: oh
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: nvm then
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Tara: i had to! unless i wanted to fail
29/03/2022, 18:17 - Patsy Ng: mood
29/03/2022, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: we were asking our tutor yesterday about third year modules and he was like "the most difficult module is the systems one, not because of the theory, but because you have to use c"
29/03/2022, 18:18 - Tara: the school has its own C++ configurations and i had to install that stupid version
29/03/2022, 18:18 - Tara: it was terrible and outdated
29/03/2022, 18:18 - Tara: (in terms of aesthetics, everything else was fine)
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Patsy Ng: matey that sounds painful
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Tara: the comma was misused oops
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Tara: i mean
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Tara: the aesthetics were 👎 
everything else was fine
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Tara: i mean i still had to code in C++
29/03/2022, 18:19 - Tara: which was painful anyway
29/03/2022, 20:39 - Rishibh Prakash: Idk if they have it for other fields but there is the math genealogy project doing exactly that: https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/
29/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: Yes I found that too
29/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: And half their advisers are there
29/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: But not the recent ones
29/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: Ok as in besides one guy
29/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: Who's in CS
29/03/2022, 20:41 - Tara: Hmm I'm now surprisingly into award shows
29/03/2022, 20:42 - Tara: I like the comedians hosting the show
29/03/2022, 20:42 - Tara: Aka Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
29/03/2022, 20:48 - Rishibh Prakash: One of my professors has Lagrange and Euler as his mathematical ancestors 😱
29/03/2022, 20:48 - Tara: Noooo
29/03/2022, 20:48 - Tara: Bro
29/03/2022, 20:48 - Tara: Are you kidding me
He's practically royalty
29/03/2022, 20:49 - Tara: Imagine basing academic standing based on their doctoral ancestors
29/03/2022, 20:50 - Tara: Oh you know we were talking last night about how maths should revamp their "levels" and instead have time periods
29/03/2022, 20:50 - Tara: Like my highest level of maths rn would be 1940-50
29/03/2022, 20:52 - Tara: Current*
29/03/2022, 20:55 - Patsy Ng: oh my gosh
29/03/2022, 20:56 - Patsy Ng: doing the crossword "item of bed clothes" is a clue
29/03/2022, 20:56 - Patsy Ng: i thought it was like "shirt" or sth but it's "sheet"
29/03/2022, 20:56 - Tara: Sheets aren't clothes
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Tara: Huh
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Patsy Ng: i always thought bed clothes were the clothes that just. pile up on the end of the bed for whatever reason
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Tara: I thought they were clothes you sleep in??
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Patsy Ng: it's not meant to be bed clothes, it's a corruption of bed cloths
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Patsy Ng: the cloths that go on the bed
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Tara: Huh
29/03/2022, 20:57 - Tara: Ok

29/03/2022, 21:00 - Tara: Hmm I thought 1 would be hand brake / foot brake
29/03/2022, 21:00 - Patsy Ng: pedal
29/03/2022, 21:00 - Patsy Ng: so foot pedal i guess?
29/03/2022, 21:00 - Patsy Ng: bc you can't really have hand pedals
29/03/2022, 21:00 - Tara: Yeah
29/03/2022, 21:36 - Cindy Yang: huh

30/03/2022, 07:38 - Patsy Ng: is this for a video essay
30/03/2022, 07:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: (it's not art I'm just unhinged)
30/03/2022, 07:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nah i just rhought it would be funny to do it

30/03/2022, 10:34 - Tara: TIL when I'm in a zoom call my right eye is blackened out

30/03/2022, 10:50 - Tara: My guy needed help with nuclear physics which happened to be my favourite topic
30/03/2022, 10:52 - Cindy Yang: nice
30/03/2022, 10:52 - Cindy Yang: ah yes
30/03/2022, 10:52 - Cindy Yang: i like did two tutoring sessions in total lmao

30/03/2022, 10:58 - Cindy Yang: agh im in a life sciences calculus class that’s supposed to be basically like calc 2 for bio majors but i’m feeling very little of the bio
30/03/2022, 10:59 - Tara: Is this the one with the differential equations
30/03/2022, 10:59 - Cindy Yang: yea
30/03/2022, 11:00 - Tara: Bruh I sent it to my friend to check my answer and she hadn't gotten to differential equations yet
30/03/2022, 11:00 - Tara: They had only done linear at that point
30/03/2022, 11:00 - Cindy Yang: it’s like sometimes they just teach the stuff very abstractly without once bringing up bio and i’m just like okay this is just numbers in a box what does this have to do with anything
30/03/2022, 11:00 - Cindy Yang: damnnn
30/03/2022, 11:00 - Cindy Yang: what does she study

30/03/2022, 11:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which wasn't productive but it sure was easy
30/03/2022, 11:16 - Tara: Maybe now that I'm at uni and actually doing textbook questions I'm like ???? What was I doing
30/03/2022, 11:18 - Cindy Yang: damb

Can he make the wacky shapes in foam
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Cindy Yang: no i think he only makes the smoothies lmao
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Scandalous
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Cindy Yang: and some of the food
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Cindy Yang: he was telling me about fucking up this egg or something
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Eggs are indeed fucked up
31/03/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Just generally
31/03/2022, 00:44 - Tara: He couldn't have made it worse
31/03/2022, 00:44 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
31/03/2022, 00:44 - Tara: Do you see guns now that you're in America
31/03/2022, 00:45 - Tara: Sorry I went from egg->target->guns because apparently they sell them
31/03/2022, 00:45 - Tara: So weird
31/03/2022, 00:45 - Tara: Just delete em
31/03/2022, 00:45 - Tara: Fuck I was gonna sleep an hour ago
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Cindy Yang: big oof
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Then I decided to help someone in python -> started talking about bday parties -> batteries -> eggs and guns
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Cindy Yang: have not seen any yet
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Good
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: 7k cases Bois
Almost granola time
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Ok _bye_
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Cindy Yang: goodnight
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Cindy Yang: are y’all good with eigenvectors and stuff
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Patsy Ng: ooh birdo!
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Yes
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Hmu
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Tomorrow
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Cindy Yang: aight
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Tara: I mean today but I will see tomorrow
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Cindy Yang: sure
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: just had an Intense 15 mins
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Cindy Yang: doing what
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: working on a practical
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Cindy Yang: damn
31/03/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: got up to testing and get everything to work
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: More like an impractical amirite
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Cindy Yang: someone slap him!
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Patsy Ng: then i reread the spec and realized i'd done the wrong thing for part 2
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Tara: Pure comedian shit
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Cindy Yang: rip
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Tara: Aw no
31/03/2022, 00:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You're welcome to try
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Patsy Ng: luckily i'm hyped up on sugar and tea and went Oh I Can Fix This and it now works
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Patsy Ng: i think
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: Gonna tie a bunch of these together
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: And Yeet it
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Patsy Ng: i have to rewrite some of the tests but the ones that should work so far do work
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: At you
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: Awesome
31/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: You got this
31/03/2022, 00:51 - Tara: @16787937884 send eigenvectors and stuff before you forget
31/03/2022, 00:51 - Patsy Ng: remember when we got one of these but a fish at the book fair and then broke it within like ten mins
31/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: I'm not taking a maths course and I feel weird
31/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: What did you do with the poor slappies
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: Speaking of tiny hands 
I got my friend a set of tiny hands
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Patsy Ng: we slapped each other with them and it popped
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: For her bday
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: Ah
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: Violent /s
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Patsy Ng: them as in the fish and the bag it came in
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Patsy Ng: throwing hands
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: *le gasp* you are a genius
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: I'll get sister a set
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Cindy Yang: o aight
31/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: And we can throw them at each other instead of fighting

31/03/2022, 06:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: on one hadn her politics aren't great
31/03/2022, 06:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but on the other
31/03/2022, 06:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: what a serve
31/03/2022, 06:26 - Cindy Yang: bruh
31/03/2022, 07:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3172362/traditional-chinese-medicine-tcm-and-covid-19-what-you?utm_content=article&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1648682316-1

wow i hate this!
31/03/2022, 07:41 - Damien Fung: ah shite i went to an event venue but didn't realize that the event's tmr
31/03/2022, 07:41 - Cindy Yang: oof
31/03/2022, 09:05 - Cindy Yang: yo i just realized that this guy who i sit near in math class and talk to sometimes is someone i ghosted on tinder like half a year ago
31/03/2022, 09:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lmaoooooooooooooooo
31/03/2022, 09:29 - Tara: do i have to row reduce or can you do that
31/03/2022, 09:30 - Tara: you can do it
31/03/2022, 09:30 - Tara: it shouldn't be very bad
31/03/2022, 09:32 - Tara: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 09:32 - Tara: I mean it's not good but I don't want to do it
31/03/2022, 09:32 - Tara: You should know row reduction
31/03/2022, 09:37 - Cindy Yang: 😬 have not been taught that
31/03/2022, 09:37 - Cindy Yang: but it’s aight thanks
31/03/2022, 09:37 - Tara: what
31/03/2022, 09:37 - Tara: how have you not been taught row reduction but they want you to find eigenvalues
31/03/2022, 09:37 - Tara: that's like
31/03/2022, 09:38 - Tara: fundamental stuff
31/03/2022, 09:38 - Cindy Yang: i mean idk maybe we were and it just wasn’t called that
31/03/2022, 09:38 - Tara: row reduction = matrix simplification
31/03/2022, 09:38 - Tara: using the rows
31/03/2022, 09:39 - Tara: like idk if you wanna reduce
1 2
4 4
you could do R1 = 2*R1-R2 to get
-2 0
4 4
31/03/2022, 09:40 - Cindy Yang: hmm
31/03/2022, 09:40 - Tara: R1=(-0.5)*R1
R2=0.25*R2
1 0
1 1
R2=R2-R1
1 0
0 1
31/03/2022, 09:41 - Tara: no way
31/03/2022, 09:41 - Tara: how are you gonna find the eigenvectors without row reduction
31/03/2022, 09:41 - Tara: what are synonyms for it
31/03/2022, 09:41 - Tara: bye
31/03/2022, 09:41 - Tara: gaussian elimination
31/03/2022, 09:42 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 09:42 - Cindy Yang: idk if that has anything to do with it
31/03/2022, 09:43 - Damien Fung: ye that's row reduction
31/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: that aint row reduction thats the opposite of linear algebra
31/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: why go from matrices to systems
31/03/2022, 09:43 - Tara: of equations
31/03/2022, 09:43 - Cindy Yang: idk i find it pretty easy
31/03/2022, 09:44 - Cindy Yang: they were like u can use matrices to solve systems of equations :)
31/03/2022, 09:45 - Tara: ok fine yes row reduction is whazizname but it's just presented differently
31/03/2022, 09:45 - Damien Fung: i mean in essence it's still row reduction
31/03/2022, 09:45 - Cindy Yang: i see
31/03/2022, 09:45 - Tara: ugh fine i'll reduce it
31/03/2022, 09:45 - Tara: later
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Tara: because it requires effort
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Cindy Yang: no it’s ok u don’t have to do any more
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Damien Fung: wait lemme take a look
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Tara: oh bless you
it involves variables and square roots
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Damien Fung: i still got wolfram alpha premium so free workings
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Tara: ^
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Cindy Yang: nice
31/03/2022, 09:46 - Damien Fung: wait char do you want it
31/03/2022, 09:47 - Cindy Yang: sure
31/03/2022, 09:47 - Tara: do you want tips
31/03/2022, 09:48 - Tara: you can do three things
swap rows
multiply rows by nonzero integers
addition / subtraction
31/03/2022, 09:48 - Tara: the goal is to get as close to the identity matrix as possible
31/03/2022, 09:53 - Cindy Yang: i see
31/03/2022, 10:22 - Cindy Yang: anyway ye thanks for the help
31/03/2022, 12:16 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 12:43 - Tara: Did it work
31/03/2022, 12:43 - Tara: Oops did I mess up the quadratic part
31/03/2022, 12:43 - Tara: Nah
31/03/2022, 12:43 - Tara: That's one thing I'll never forget probably
31/03/2022, 12:48 - Cindy Yang: did not actually work on that question more yet but ya i think i get it
31/03/2022, 17:04 - Patsy Ng: i wish teams had more reaction options

i have never wanted a crying reaction more than when the logic lecturer made a joke just now
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Damien Fung: aw man i'm so glad i don't have to use teams anymore
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Damien Fung: that stuff ate my computer's resources like crazy
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Patsy Ng: all in-person now?
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Damien Fung: mostly
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Damien Fung: some classes are hybrid
31/03/2022, 17:05 - Patsy Ng: wacko
31/03/2022, 19:40 - Rishibh Prakash: You don't have to do row reduction to find eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Another thing you can do is let lambda be a variable, find the determinant of A - lambda * I (where I is the identity) and find what values of lambda make it 0
31/03/2022, 19:41 - Rishibh Prakash: Also this one you don't have to do any computations at all just the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
31/03/2022, 19:42 - Rishibh Prakash: (A + B)v = Av + Bv = lambda_A v + lambda_B v = (lambda _A + lambda_B)v
31/03/2022, 19:43 - Rishibh Prakash: Whoops just noticed Tara did that already
31/03/2022, 19:51 - Rishibh Prakash: Damn I just can't read

31/03/2022, 20:03 - Cindy Yang: she is wearing pyjamas
31/03/2022, 20:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah but cute ones
31/03/2022, 20:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: looks bad but there was indeed an attempt I guess
31/03/2022, 21:44 - Tara: It's aight
31/03/2022, 21:47 - Tara: I'm freee ~for the next two weeks~
31/03/2022, 21:50 - Patsy Ng: god i wish that were me
31/03/2022, 21:53 - Tara: Whatcha got
31/03/2022, 21:55 - Rishibh Prakash: one thing i will say though you can more or less read off from the top row of A - \lambda I that the vector (-2, (the b stuff)) will map to 0 which is how most often do this

also what they never tell you is that for 2x2 matrices with distinct eigenvalues \lambda_1, \lambda_2, the columns of A - \lambda_1 are the eigenvectors for eigenvalue \lambda_2
31/03/2022, 21:55 - Rishibh Prakash: imagine
31/03/2022, 21:55 - Patsy Ng: three assignments due next week

two are group projects and one of the group members hasn't worked on it in a week
31/03/2022, 21:58 - Rishibh Prakash: i also have 3 assignments due within the next few days but luckily none are group projects
31/03/2022, 21:59 - Patsy Ng: have fun
31/03/2022, 21:59 - Rishibh Prakash: will do
31/03/2022, 22:11 - Tara: Ohhh
31/03/2022, 22:12 - Tara: Wow they really kept that from us
31/03/2022, 22:12 - Tara: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 22:19 - Tara: Ok I may have forgotten I have a draft essay due next week
31/03/2022, 22:19 - Tara: Which I shall start on tomorrow
31/03/2022, 22:20 - Tara: But we finally have a midterm break! Aka Easter
31/03/2022, 22:20 - Tara: I hate this school!
31/03/2022, 22:20 - Tara: Our holidays are pathetic
31/03/2022, 22:33 - Tara: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 22:33 - Tara: Oml
31/03/2022, 22:33 - Tara: No
31/03/2022, 22:50 - Tara: I like the Witcher solely because the NPCs run faster than Geralt
31/03/2022, 23:11 - Tara: Nvm it's a horrifying game with creepy monsters and zombies
31/03/2022, 23:12 - Patsy Ng: haven't you been playing the witcher for years now
31/03/2022, 23:14 - Cindy Yang: wow google streetview car just drove past
31/03/2022, 23:14 - Patsy Ng: did you pose
31/03/2022, 23:14 - Cindy Yang: no i didn’t notice early enough
31/03/2022, 23:15 - Patsy Ng: f
31/03/2022, 23:21 - Cindy Yang: yayy
31/03/2022, 23:23 - Tara: Just 1.5
31/03/2022, 23:24 - Tara: It's the first game I got on the switch and I've finished the story mode twice
31/03/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Now I'm gonna finish _everything_
31/03/2022, 23:24 - Tara: All quests, equipment, mutagens etc
31/03/2022, 23:24 - Cindy Yang: dang
31/03/2022, 23:26 - Tara: I'm a scaredy cat when it comes to caves
31/03/2022, 23:26 - Tara: Because zombies
31/03/2022, 23:26 - Tara: It's worse than Skyrim
31/03/2022, 23:27 - Tara: At least there there's only one skeleton fucker
In the Witcher there are multiple types
31/03/2022, 23:27 - Tara: it's been a while since I've played Skyrim so o may be forgetting
31/03/2022, 23:35 - Cindy Yang: skeleton fucker as in a fucker who is a skeleton or.
31/03/2022, 23:37 - Cindy Yang: had vegan mac and cheese yesterday and it was Not Good
31/03/2022, 23:38 - Rishibh Prakash: within the span of the past few days, the temperatures gone from 12 to -8 to -2 to 14
31/03/2022, 23:38 - Rishibh Prakash: toronto do you mind picking a side
31/03/2022, 23:39 - Patsy Ng: ooh more hail!
31/03/2022, 23:40 - Cindy Yang: damn
31/03/2022, 23:41 - Cindy Yang: during the day?
31/03/2022, 23:42 - Rishibh Prakash: i mean the temperature hasnt fluctuated that wildly in a single day but everyday is very much a surprise
31/03/2022, 23:42 - Cindy Yang: damn
31/03/2022, 23:43 - Patsy Ng: keeps you on your toes
31/03/2022, 23:43 - Cindy Yang: have gotten three emails from this lab on campus desperately calling for applicants lmao
31/03/2022, 23:43 - Patsy Ng: I keep trying to get footage of it hailing on the grass but by the time I've noticed and put my boots and coat on it lets up so it won't look as good and it's So Annoying
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Cindy Yang: damn
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Cindy Yang: it do be like that
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Cindy Yang: would apply but like this is the work schedule
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Cindy Yang: and minimum commitment of two yeara
31/03/2022, 23:44 - Patsy Ng: bruh
31/03/2022, 23:45 - Patsy Ng: no wonder they're not getting applicants
01/04/2022, 00:42 - Tara: Fucker who's a skeleton
01/04/2022, 00:42 - Tara: But with mods you never know
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Damien Fung: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Damien Fung: y'all i got so excited
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Cindy Yang: what happened
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Damien Fung: got an email saying co-op application
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Damien Fung: and turns out they were just saying they're late
01/04/2022, 01:12 - Damien Fung: which was already very apparent
01/04/2022, 01:13 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
01/04/2022, 01:13 - Cindy Yang: big oof
01/04/2022, 01:13 - Damien Fung: also my car is here! getting it in a few hours
01/04/2022, 01:17 - Patsy Ng: take a photo with it while slapping it like a car salesman
01/04/2022, 01:17 - Damien Fung: nah nah
01/04/2022, 01:17 - Damien Fung: ain't devaluing my car more than i have to
01/04/2022, 01:17 - Damien Fung: but i will take all the dumb photos
01/04/2022, 01:18 - Damien Fung: also i think my car has the add on where they have automatic parking so I won't crash!
01/04/2022, 01:18 - Patsy Ng: you are not gonna thanos snap the car by slapping its metal chassis with your soft meaty human hand
01/04/2022, 01:18 - Patsy Ng: nice
01/04/2022, 01:18 - Damien Fung: but the fresh coat of paint!
01/04/2022, 01:19 - Damien Fung: man how did i get to a point where i care about paint quality
01/04/2022, 01:21 - Patsy Ng: you're just instantly sprouted a moustache and been jammed into a polo shirt

1970s dad transformation
01/04/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: oh no
01/04/2022, 01:22 - Damien Fung: i haven't shaved in a few days so i got a stubble if that counts

03/04/2022, 22:18 - Tara: I'm not watching it
03/04/2022, 22:18 - Tara: It sounds stupid
03/04/2022, 22:18 - Tara: Very white saviour-y
03/04/2022, 22:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah it's terrible
03/04/2022, 22:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Even worse than the trailer makes it seem
03/04/2022, 22:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also a [musical]
03/04/2022, 22:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because it's from that era where slumdog millionaire was big so Hollywood were trying to make fake Bollywood films
03/04/2022, 22:19 - Tara: If it's supposed to be an homage to Bollywood then yeah makes sense
03/04/2022, 22:19 - Tara: I will judge this movie solely from listening to the soundtrack
03/04/2022, 22:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh god
03/04/2022, 22:19 - Tara: Good day to you
03/04/2022, 22:20 - Tara: No nvm the songs have English titles
03/04/2022, 22:20 - Tara: I'm good
03/04/2022, 22:22 - Tara: They dragged Sonu Nigam into this? Shameful
03/04/2022, 23:44 - Patsy Ng: may i rant about my compsci group please
03/04/2022, 23:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sure
03/04/2022, 23:45 - Tara: Oui go for it
03/04/2022, 23:45 - Patsy Ng: ok so we have two projects due next week (they're running simultaneously)
03/04/2022, 23:46 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
03/04/2022, 23:46 - Patsy Ng: for one of them
03/04/2022, 23:47 - Patsy Ng: the top three parts are compulsory requirements and the last bit is optional requirements for if you want a high grade (there are more but i selected the easy ones bc we Do Not have time to do the hard reqs)

all the stuff i've ticked off is what i've done
03/04/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: the second and third sections were what the other people were supposed to do
03/04/2022, 23:50 - Patsy Ng: but the person who was supposed to do the second section only a) did part of it (the stuff i said to redo in pandas), b) did that three weeks ago and hasn't done anything else despite c) leaving themselves comments in the code to make it better bc they were processing the _size 50000 dataset_ using for loops

which is why i redid it all
03/04/2022, 23:54 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
03/04/2022, 23:54 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
03/04/2022, 23:56 - Tara: Oh my god they're useless
03/04/2022, 23:56 - Tara: They haven't done anything??
03/04/2022, 23:57 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
03/04/2022, 23:57 - Tara: Isn't the last bit supposed to be their job as the visualiser
03/04/2022, 23:58 - Tara: Where's the third person
03/04/2022, 23:58 - Patsy Ng: partly

they can use some of the descriptive stats from the analysis but there are gonna be some things that they have to process themselves
03/04/2022, 23:58 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
03/04/2022, 23:59 - Patsy Ng: bottom (cs368)
04/04/2022, 00:01 - Tara: Christ
04/04/2022, 00:02 - Patsy Ng: This message was deleted
04/04/2022, 00:03 - Patsy Ng: gonna try ping the third person to ask Why Aren't You Working On The Projects That Are Collectively 83.666% Of Our Grade and is this too agg (last time they had a broken laptop + chronic illness flareup that they didn't tell us about until _after_ we'd submitted and they'd done nothing)

oh also @<third person> if there's sth preventing you from working on the projects now, like last time, it would be great to know about it so we can help
04/04/2022, 00:03 - Patsy Ng: deleted bc as much as i am Annoyed i am not gonna doxx their discord id number thing idk what it's called
04/04/2022, 00:04 - Tara: Yes good idea
04/04/2022, 00:04 - Tara: I hope they're fine
04/04/2022, 00:04 - Tara: But also
04/04/2022, 00:04 - Tara: Bro get it together you're just dragging your team down
04/04/2022, 00:04 - Tara: To the useless fellow not you
04/04/2022, 00:05 - Patsy Ng: ok thank you for the feedback
04/04/2022, 00:06 - Tara: If you wanna be really harsh
Bring up the grade weighting
04/04/2022, 00:06 - Patsy Ng: now that i have ranted i am ready to attempt being nice for the rest of the week (hopefully)
04/04/2022, 00:07 - Patsy Ng: that feels a bit. extreme

considering the only reason they're on this module this year is they didn't earn enough compsci credits last year so they couldn't move on to third year
04/04/2022, 00:08 - Tara: Hmm ok fair
04/04/2022, 00:25 - Patsy Ng: update: they have replied to my ping and i have assigned them an easy task
04/04/2022, 00:27 - Patsy Ng: it is. somewhat reassuring to be the De Facto Group Leader since i know exactly which bits of the prac are working and what needs doing and also i don't have to get used to anyone else's coding style but also. it is Weird having them ask me what they should do. like. i am not your boss this is supposed to be a Team Thing
04/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: Yeah I get that
Whenever there's a group project someone's always the unspoken leader
04/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: Yay progress
04/04/2022, 02:46 - Damien Fung: dude i did the same thing with my data science group project
04/04/2022, 02:47 - Damien Fung: so we're heavily graded on how we use our workflow tools and one of my teammates was directly pushing his changes to the main branch and so when we called him out for that he used branches
04/04/2022, 02:48 - Damien Fung: problem is that when he started using branches and made pull requests for the rest of us to code review he just didn't bother waiting and directly accepted them himself
04/04/2022, 03:12 - Patsy Ng: I do not know enough about workflow tools to commiserate properly but yeah dude sounds awful
04/04/2022, 03:12 - Patsy Ng: in terms of like "this is basic stuff you should know from watching lectures"
04/04/2022, 03:13 - Patsy Ng: also got the percentage slightly wrong it's actually 83.333%
04/04/2022, 03:13 - Patsy Ng: so like. slightly less awful but very very microscopically less awful
04/04/2022, 03:22 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 03:23 - Patsy Ng: flatmate and i made food and left some for another flatmate but we decided to make it Difficult and Ominous
04/04/2022, 03:38 - Damien Fung: spooky
04/04/2022, 03:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: exciting!
04/04/2022, 03:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You clearly have better flatmates than I

04/04/2022, 07:48 - Damien Fung: it's raining rn and i didn't turn on the aircon so it started fogging up
04/04/2022, 07:48 - Damien Fung: panicked and pulled over and fixed it up right away
04/04/2022, 08:06 - Cindy Yang: oof
04/04/2022, 08:06 - Cindy Yang: nice that u fixed it quick

04/04/2022, 10:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but
04/04/2022, 10:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I just found out you can bulk buy small glass jars
04/04/2022, 10:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: for like 30 pounds for 50
04/04/2022, 10:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and i kinda wanna
04/04/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like imagine how pretty my tea collection would be!
04/04/2022, 10:17 - Tara: london > tea
04/04/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah that's true
04/04/2022, 10:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can always buy my jars in may
04/04/2022, 10:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can't wait to have everything in uniform jars it's gonna be so pretty
04/04/2022, 10:18 - Tara: im excited for you
04/04/2022, 10:18 - Tara: /g
04/04/2022, 11:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 11:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This is an old marmalade one I finished while isolating
04/04/2022, 11:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sterilises it by boiling
04/04/2022, 11:20 - Cindy Yang: o nice
04/04/2022, 11:20 - Cindy Yang: did u make it
04/04/2022, 11:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah in Korean class

04/04/2022, 12:49 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 13:27 - Damien Fung: why are we born in this world just to suffer
04/04/2022, 13:27 - Damien Fung: why do statisticians have to use taylor series
04/04/2022, 13:28 - Damien Fung: this world is truly a cruel one
04/04/2022, 22:30 - Cindy Yang: oof
04/04/2022, 22:30 - Cindy Yang: what’s that
04/04/2022, 22:30 - Cindy Yang: funky
05/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: Why do you need to use them for stats
05/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: And til it's used in CS
Why
05/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: Oh I see
05/04/2022, 00:26 - Tara: It's just used in approximations
05/04/2022, 08:11 - Damien Fung: guys i just got reinvited to google foobar
05/04/2022, 08:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oooooooh
05/04/2022, 08:35 - Patsy Ng: ooh fun
05/04/2022, 09:02 - Patsy Ng: hhh one of my compsci groupmates just got covid
05/04/2022, 09:03 - Patsy Ng: tempted to be like "hey,,, so two of us got covid,,, can we get an extension pretty please"
05/04/2022, 09:05 - Cindy Yang: noice
05/04/2022, 09:06 - Cindy Yang: i mean that sounds like a reasonable request
05/04/2022, 09:06 - Cindy Yang: accidentally typed te at first for request and almost clicked the autosuggest bringing up tequila
05/04/2022, 09:07 - Patsy Ng: you'd think so but that person was sick last time too so we asked for an extension and they said that wasn't a valid reason for a group project

the implication being that the healthy members of the group pick up the slack
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Damien Fung: yeah same happened for my stats class
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Cindy Yang: wow that’s shitty
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Damien Fung: friend's mom passed away just last week and prof refused to give any extensions or exemptions to him
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Patsy Ng: maybe we all have to get covid
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Cindy Yang: bruhh
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Patsy Ng: oh noooo what
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Cindy Yang: that’s fucked
05/04/2022, 09:08 - Patsy Ng: that is infinitely worse
05/04/2022, 09:09 - Patsy Ng: is it the professor being a douche or the faculty rules
05/04/2022, 09:21 - Damien Fung: being a douche ig
05/04/2022, 09:21 - Damien Fung: there aren't any rules in the faculty and other profs let him go
05/04/2022, 09:22 - Damien Fung: but the prof said it was bc they'd  be dropping a bunch of coursework so it should be sufficient for the time he took to mourn
05/04/2022, 09:23 - Patsy Ng: what the fuck
05/04/2022, 09:23 - Cindy Yang: bruh
05/04/2022, 09:23 - Patsy Ng: one week is sufficient time to mourn your mom???
05/04/2022, 09:52 - Damien Fung: prof is dropping like 3 weeks of content but yeah it's still really dickish
05/04/2022, 09:53 - Damien Fung: friend was fine with it bc we calculated and she should be in the clear
05/04/2022, 09:58 - Cindy Yang: damn
05/04/2022, 09:59 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
05/04/2022, 09:59 - Cindy Yang: saw a squirrel perched on a branch pulling them off a tree and eating them
05/04/2022, 09:59 - Patsy Ng: eat them
05/04/2022, 09:59 - Patsy Ng: find out what they taste like
05/04/2022, 10:00 - Patsy Ng: experience the joy of being a squirrel for a few fleeting seconds
05/04/2022, 10:00 - Cindy Yang: theyre bitter
05/04/2022, 10:00 - Patsy Ng: that was fast
05/04/2022, 10:01 - Cindy Yang: i saw ur msg and was like sure why nto
05/04/2022, 10:01 - Cindy Yang: not tasty
05/04/2022, 10:01 - Damien Fung: are they supposed to be edible by humans?
05/04/2022, 10:02 - Patsy Ng: char I think you deserve an award
05/04/2022, 10:02 - Patsy Ng: you are the first person to actually eat a thing after I reflexively go "eat it" to anything odd
05/04/2022, 10:04 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
05/04/2022, 10:04 - Cindy Yang: eh it was just a seed
05/04/2022, 10:04 - Cindy Yang: ok apparently they are edible actually but taste better cooked
05/04/2022, 10:05 - Cindy Yang: did not actually eat it tho i just chewed it
05/04/2022, 10:08 - Patsy Ng: :(
05/04/2022, 10:09 - Patsy Ng: harvest them and cook them
05/04/2022, 10:10 - Cindy Yang: tempted to
05/04/2022, 10:11 - Patsy Ng: free food
05/04/2022, 10:11 - Patsy Ng: do you ever have to cook
05/04/2022, 10:25 - Cindy Yang: nop

05/04/2022, 17:04 - Tara: bruh what is wrong with them
05/04/2022, 17:04 - Tara: the commenters
05/04/2022, 17:06 - Patsy Ng: what on earth was the outfit

05/04/2022, 17:11 - Tara: i take this back
05/04/2022, 17:13 - Patsy Ng: looks like he stepped out of the early 80s
05/04/2022, 22:21 - Tara: Oh guys I forgot to tell y'all
05/04/2022, 22:21 - Tara: I sent a admittedly harsh message to Sienna because she called me twice and I was kinda annoyed
05/04/2022, 22:21 - Tara: So uh
05/04/2022, 22:21 - Tara: Idk if she's coming back
05/04/2022, 22:24 - Tara: Sorry about that

05/04/2022, 22:28 - Tara: Oh yeah
05/04/2022, 22:28 - Tara: It happened like two weeks ago and I forgot about it so

06/04/2022, 01:36 - Cindy Yang: nice
06/04/2022, 02:06 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
06/04/2022, 02:17 - Patsy Ng: i really need a haircut but i just don't have time until all my coursework is in and that won't be till monday now and i'm so. tempted. to just grab my scissors and Hack It Off but that would be Such A Bad Idea
06/04/2022, 02:17 - Damien Fung: mood
06/04/2022, 02:17 - Damien Fung: i should really book an appointment for later today
06/04/2022, 02:18 - Patsy Ng: wait you need to book?
06/04/2022, 02:18 - Patsy Ng: you don't just. go to a walk in?
06/04/2022, 02:21 - Damien Fung: it's in the student union building so everyone goes there
06/04/2022, 02:21 - Damien Fung: they only have 2 stylists so yeah gotta book
06/04/2022, 02:23 - Patsy Ng: ah wacko
06/04/2022, 02:23 - Patsy Ng: i just. picked the one that seemed the most queer-friendly
06/04/2022, 02:24 - Patsy Ng: they also said they were the only asian barber in town so win-win i guess
06/04/2022, 02:26 - Damien Fung: yeah these guys are chinese so it gets awkward when i use my increasingly horrible chinese pronunciation
06/04/2022, 02:28 - Patsy Ng: put on a canadian accent instead and pretend you've lived in canada your whole entire life and don't speak a lick of chinese
06/04/2022, 02:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh speaking of
06/04/2022, 02:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was in a food place earlier

06/04/2022, 02:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And they were gossiping in mandarin
06/04/2022, 02:29 - Damien Fung: nah nah the guy i go to speaks only chinese lol
06/04/2022, 02:29 - Damien Fung: well not only but it's better to speak chinese so he doesn't do the wrong thing
06/04/2022, 02:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: About how their one friend is Chinese but has no culture, is bad at speaking the language, the friend's parents speak English to them etc etc etc
06/04/2022, 02:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just like really judgy shit
06/04/2022, 02:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I had considered talking to them when I first heard them start speaking mandarin but after this mess I was like "nah I'm good"
06/04/2022, 02:31 - Patsy Ng: what just straight up hello there fellow youths how are you?
06/04/2022, 02:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk
06/04/2022, 02:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In any case
06/04/2022, 02:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Huge oof to hear what people gossip about when they assume nobody can hear

06/04/2022, 22:55 - Cindy Yang: hmmm
06/04/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Trying to organise a zoom interview to film for my internship and
06/04/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Uni professors
06/04/2022, 22:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Atrocious at texting
06/04/2022, 22:58 - Cindy Yang: oof
06/04/2022, 22:58 - Patsy Ng: you're _texting_ them?
06/04/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I have their WhatsApp and they don't respond to emails in a timely manner
06/04/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So yes
06/04/2022, 23:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
06/04/2022, 23:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I understand it's a holdover from like, email and letter writing
07/04/2022, 00:55 - Tara: It's like that scene in B99 when Rosa went to jail and captain Holt kept saying her name
07/04/2022, 00:56 - Tara: https://youtu.be/bMODyA5QZ2Y
07/04/2022, 00:56 - Tara: You're more than just a number, Martin...

07/04/2022, 00:57 - Tara: Same to same
07/04/2022, 01:41 - Patsy Ng: just did a three hour buddy programming session with one of my compsci group mates and it was So Fun And Good is this what it could have been all along i am Buzzing and Shaking
07/04/2022, 01:42 - Patsy Ng: the haskell project task is to implement a programming language via an interpreter so it can do basic stuff like have variables, perform basic maths operations, and print stuff
07/04/2022, 01:43 - Patsy Ng: but we just implemented complex numbers and it is mmmmmm so excitingggg
07/04/2022, 05:10 - Cindy Yang: noice
07/04/2022, 06:22 - Rishibh Prakash: iirc haskell actually stems from an area of math called category theory
07/04/2022, 06:22 - Rishibh Prakash: which is kind of like doing math on a meta level
07/04/2022, 06:23 - Rishibh Prakash: anyway the only reason i mention it is because i wanted to share this delightful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Ek86IH-3Y

07/04/2022, 10:19 - Tara: Are you still friends with the WIS people
07/04/2022, 10:19 - Rishibh Prakash: We've also snuck into an actual lecture hall and played movies on the big screen (multiple times:) )
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Tara: Le gasp
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Rishibh Prakash: I mean I live with Adrian and Eric...
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Tara: You do??
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Tara: I thought you were still in a dorm
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Tara: My god I need an update from you
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Rishibh Prakash: Nah that was just first year
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Rishibh Prakash: Honestly it's very possible I forgot to mention that on here
07/04/2022, 10:20 - Tara: It's ok
07/04/2022, 10:21 - Rishibh Prakash: Have I mentioned that my parents have moved to Paraguay?
07/04/2022, 10:21 - Tara: Ah that explains why I haven't seen them
07/04/2022, 10:21 - Tara: Omg
07/04/2022, 10:21 - Rishibh Prakash: Yup there you go
07/04/2022, 10:21 - Tara: You mentioned a while ago that they might leave HK 
Didn't realise it was now
07/04/2022, 10:22 - Rishibh Prakash: If by now you mean January
07/04/2022, 10:22 - Tara: Bruh I was mildly concerned because I always see your parents and grandmother walking
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Rishibh Prakash: Well I think that's all the major news from me at least
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Tara: Waow
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Tara: Nice
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Tara: Are you a TA because I feel like you should be one
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Rishibh Prakash: This does make it _very_ unlikely that I'll be coming to Hong Kong any time in the near future
07/04/2022, 10:23 - Rishibh Prakash: Oh man I would love to be a TA
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Tara: 🥲
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Tara: We shall all see each other again
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Rishibh Prakash: I have applied for positions this summer, let's see if it works out 😅
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Tara: One day
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Tara: Good luck my dude
07/04/2022, 10:24 - Rishibh Prakash: gracias 🙏
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: I wanna do another independent project
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: But in elec
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: But idk how to get in
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Rishibh Prakash: ps anybody ever code in assembly?
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: Like in year 1 I just did really well in the comp course and they were like here do a CS project
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: Yes
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Tara: Doing a course rn
07/04/2022, 10:25 - Rishibh Prakash: lol same
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Tara: Ah nice
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Tara: But why
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Rishibh Prakash: had to make frogger in it for a project
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Tara: I'm doing a computer architecture course
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Rishibh Prakash: same
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Tara: Oh yeah you're doing CS too
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Rishibh Prakash: technically i am yes
07/04/2022, 10:26 - Rishibh Prakash: just wondering if anyone else has suffered through the agony
07/04/2022, 10:28 - Tara: We're programming in MIPS and it doesn't seem too bad so far
07/04/2022, 10:28 - Rishibh Prakash: we did mips as well
07/04/2022, 10:28 - Tara: But probably because it's just basics rn
07/04/2022, 10:28 - Rishibh Prakash: ok its not _that_ bad but debugging is kind of a pain
07/04/2022, 10:29 - Rishibh Prakash: guess the trick is to just not make any mistakes :/
07/04/2022, 10:29 - Tara: Tbh I don't think I can say anything rn 
Hardest thing we've done is if else statements and for loops
07/04/2022, 10:30 - Tara: I want to be able to complain about it 🥲
07/04/2022, 10:30 - Tara: That's how I know I'm learning stuff /s
07/04/2022, 10:31 - Rishibh Prakash: i feel like assembly is the one language that really encourages you to _not_ define functions
07/04/2022, 10:31 - Rishibh Prakash: unless you really have to
07/04/2022, 10:31 - Tara: Man what on earth are we learning in this course
07/04/2022, 10:31 - Tara: Where are these functions
07/04/2022, 10:31 - Tara: Wait functions as in labels?
07/04/2022, 10:32 - Rishibh Prakash: a bit more than just labels since you have to store the return address and then jump back to it once youre done
07/04/2022, 10:32 - Tara: Oh I see
07/04/2022, 10:33 - Tara: Ok well if this course doesn't teach me that stuff
I'm gonna do something over the summer
07/04/2022, 10:33 - Tara: Oh yay the government is giving more consumption vouchers
07/04/2022, 10:34 - Tara: Except it's 10k?
07/04/2022, 10:35 - Tara: Cri why can't they just let us go back to normal
07/04/2022, 10:35 - Tara: Two days ago someone dropped off testing kits and stuff because apparently we have to get tested between the 8th and 10th
07/04/2022, 10:36 - Tara: Exciting 
Never gotten tested
07/04/2022, 10:36 - Tara: Hope I don't have covid though
07/04/2022, 10:36 - Cindy Yang: dam
07/04/2022, 10:37 - Cindy Yang: ill press my thumbs for you
07/04/2022, 10:38 - Tara: Holy shit they're kidding
07/04/2022, 10:39 - Tara: So there's a limit of 3k on octopuses
07/04/2022, 10:39 - Tara: And they're supposed to distribute 4k

09/04/2022, 00:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but the lady who owns it was in cookbook plagiarism drama last year
09/04/2022, 00:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: should I go buy the food and eat it or would that be unethical
09/04/2022, 00:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh lmao I just realised it's the one from the uncle roger video

09/04/2022, 02:28 - Patsy Ng: why'd you want that photo so badly
09/04/2022, 05:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because I heard that keeping your backpack in front of you in bond street station
09/04/2022, 05:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Is the thing to do
09/04/2022, 05:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In order to not be robbed by the tall middle eastern couple
09/04/2022, 05:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: dressing so glamorously
09/04/2022, 05:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but causing so much trouble
09/04/2022, 05:48 - Patsy Ng: ohhhhh
09/04/2022, 07:27 - Cindy Yang: yesssss
09/04/2022, 07:27 - Cindy Yang: comment to keiying that u did it
09/04/2022, 08:32 - Rishibh Prakash: Wait guys remember the midterm that I said went really bad
09/04/2022, 08:33 - Rishibh Prakash: Turns out it wasn't that bad after all
09/04/2022, 08:33 - Rishibh Prakash: I somehow managed to get 82% (which I still think might be a mistake but I'll take it)
09/04/2022, 08:34 - Rishibh Prakash: Also the prof asked me to send my latex notes after I was done typing them 😊
09/04/2022, 08:34 - Damien Fung: oh shit nice
09/04/2022, 08:35 - Damien Fung: meanwhile me trying to figure out how to properly embed my r output into latex
09/04/2022, 12:27 - Cindy Yang: niceee
09/04/2022, 12:27 - Cindy Yang: funky
09/04/2022, 15:03 - Patsy Ng: nice

09/04/2022, 17:11 - Tara: trying to find photos of sister and i found out i have a bunch of screenshots of the sims 2 in 2004
09/04/2022, 17:15 - Tara: did i somehow just download all the photos from the wikia
09/04/2022, 17:15 - Tara: because what
09/04/2022, 18:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just bought the academic dishonesty chicken rice
09/04/2022, 18:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They had the audacity to make you pay extra for broth?
09/04/2022, 18:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A hate crime against me specifically
09/04/2022, 18:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meal was 9/10 tho
09/04/2022, 18:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Portions could have been bigger if they insist on charging triple what I pay in Hong Kong, but I suppose this is Artisanal and Quality or w/e
09/04/2022, 20:23 - Tara: What does it look like
09/04/2022, 20:23 - Tara: Whenever someone says chicken rice I assume it's chicken curry and rice so when you said broth I was confused
09/04/2022, 20:40 - Patsy Ng: curry soup
09/04/2022, 21:09 - Tara: Ok so like
In my family we usually eat this yellow curry which I just assumed was Curry
But a few weeks ago I googled stews because I thought hey I don't think India has "stews" anyway but turns out the curry we eat is actually kadhi
09/04/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Which is pronounced exactly like curry
09/04/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Which explains a lot because when my friends ask me what curry we eat I'm like uh hello it's just called curry
09/04/2022, 21:11 - Tara: But I was a fool
09/04/2022, 21:11 - Tara: It's kadhi
09/04/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Aka curry
09/04/2022, 21:18 - Rishibh Prakash: i had the exact same reaction
09/04/2022, 21:19 - Rishibh Prakash: its just kadhi
09/04/2022, 21:32 - Tara: I bet curry is derived from kadhi
09/04/2022, 21:37 - Tara: Wow so sister knew for years and didn't tell me
09/04/2022, 21:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 00:02 - Patsy Ng: just had a museum meeting where i got shown around one of the storerooms and one of the shelves was entirely taken up by glass dildos from a victorian-era gentleman's club

my supervisor got like. five minutes into the explanation before i realized what they were
10/04/2022, 00:12 - Cindy Yang: …wow
10/04/2022, 00:12 - Cindy Yang: very cool
10/04/2022, 00:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Only gentlemen? Good for them!
10/04/2022, 00:16 - Patsy Ng: yeah only gentlemen
10/04/2022, 00:17 - Patsy Ng: apparently the dildos also doubled as cups and during initiation into the club they had to "pleasure themselves" with the dildos, "finish" into a special dish, and drink out of the dildo cups

there was also a wig made of pubic hair, which they would wear, and a snuffbox, also full of pubic hair
10/04/2022, 00:18 - Patsy Ng: quotation marks are how my supervisor phrased it
10/04/2022, 00:18 - Cindy Yang: HELLO???
10/04/2022, 00:19 - Damien Fung: what the fuck
10/04/2022, 00:19 - Damien Fung: pat what kind of hardcore fetish porn are you watching
10/04/2022, 00:19 - Patsy Ng: nothing

this was part of museum stuff
10/04/2022, 00:20 - Damien Fung: mhm /s
10/04/2022, 00:21 - Patsy Ng: apparently sometimes people call just to ask about the dildos and ask to see them and the museum staff have to fend them off

you too can call and be one of the weirdos
10/04/2022, 00:23 - Cindy Yang: uh
10/04/2022, 00:24 - Damien Fung: wait I'm confused on how all this works

are they giving themselves prostate massages to cum? if so they'll have to pull out the dildo then cum inside of it but that already takes a moment so the room for error is non existent

then there's also the question on how much volume the cup has? unless there's like a cup extension at the end, they'd be finishing into the shaft of the staff and that would mean the dildo's hollow. So how strong would the glass need to be to endure the full strength of an asshole
10/04/2022, 00:25 - Damien Fung: there are so many questions
10/04/2022, 00:27 - Cindy Yang: um
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: bestie
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Cindy Yang: as pat said u can call and ask!
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think they probably filled the cups with wine?
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or they decanted into the cups after the fact?
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Damien Fung: unfortunately international phone fees ain't free
10/04/2022, 00:28 - Cindy Yang: send an email
10/04/2022, 00:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ok I will
10/04/2022, 00:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 00:30 - Damien Fung: oh wait misread. thought the dish was the dildo itself

in that case is there a handle on the dildo such that they won't need to be in contact with the used parts when drinking?
10/04/2022, 00:32 - Patsy Ng: i understood like half of those words
10/04/2022, 00:32 - Cindy Yang: are they clear or frosted
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think if they put the dildo inside themselves probably they are not concerned with getting their hands dirty
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Patsy Ng: clear
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Cindy Yang: hhhh
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Cindy Yang: nice
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's like eating ass with extra steps
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Cindy Yang: hhhhh
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Cindy Yang: do they have a flared base lol
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Patsy Ng: what the fuck is a flared base
10/04/2022, 00:33 - Damien Fung: true but if you're drinking wine you'd preferably not want any fluids to make the cup slippery
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Damien Fung: drinking ass
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: when the base of the object is wider than the rest
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Cindy Yang: well just like there’s a thing at the base going out so it doesn’t just end
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So that you don't lose it
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Patsy Ng: it ended at the balls
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Cindy Yang: there were balls?
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If there were balls that counts I think
10/04/2022, 00:34 - Cindy Yang: damn
10/04/2022, 00:35 - Patsy Ng: yeah the backs were left off for the cup opening
10/04/2022, 00:35 - Cindy Yang: still kinda confused how this works but alright
10/04/2022, 00:35 - Damien Fung: wait is there a pic
10/04/2022, 00:36 - Patsy Ng: you can search them up on the museum database
10/04/2022, 00:36 - Damien Fung: link?
10/04/2022, 00:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can picture it at least
10/04/2022, 00:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk what y'all need to be explained
10/04/2022, 00:36 - Patsy Ng: the club was in anstruther if you want to search
10/04/2022, 00:37 - Damien Fung: i can picture it but there are an endless amount of possible dildo shapes
10/04/2022, 00:37 - Patsy Ng: https://collections.st-andrews.ac.uk/collection/museum-collections/1004090
10/04/2022, 00:37 - Damien Fung: they're like lightsabers in every way
10/04/2022, 00:38 - Cindy Yang: which collection is it in
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Patsy Ng: generic museum collections probably
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Patsy Ng: not special collections
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Damien Fung: a closet, by causing him to propel his Penis until full erection. When thus ready he was escorted with four puffs of the Breath-Horn before the Brethren or Knighthood, and was ordered by the Sovereign to place his Genitals upon the Testing Platter, which was covered with a folded white napkin. The Members and Knights two and two came round in a state of erection and touched the Novice Penis to Penis
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Damien Fung: nice they did a 4 way dock
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 00:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 00:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can't find any evidence for the prick glass actually being used for rectal stimulation
10/04/2022, 00:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It doesn't look practical anyway
10/04/2022, 00:40 - Patsy Ng: wait y'all found the dildos already?
10/04/2022, 00:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah so it's not a dildo
10/04/2022, 00:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's a hollow glass designed in such a way that if you attempt to drink from the balls it spurts water down your front
10/04/2022, 00:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In fact it doesn't seem like a gay sex club at all, it seems like a club devoted to the idea of sex, yeah, and one where sex took place, but the homoeroticism looks like a general lack of imagination on their part
10/04/2022, 00:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It looks like women were involved to some capacity
10/04/2022, 00:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But not as club members
10/04/2022, 00:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Anyway the glasses almost certainly never went inside anybody
10/04/2022, 00:43 - Damien Fung: oooo a siphon?
10/04/2022, 00:43 - Patsy Ng: hmm i probably misunderstood the explanation then
10/04/2022, 00:43 - Patsy Ng: i was wondering how such a club got to exist so famously back then
10/04/2022, 00:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Royals were involved I guess
10/04/2022, 00:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Again, not a gay sex club
10/04/2022, 00:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just a club where men did a bunch of sex things that now read as gay
10/04/2022, 00:44 - Damien Fung: so a frat house
10/04/2022, 00:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah exactly
10/04/2022, 00:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A frat house is exactly how I would describe what I am reading
10/04/2022, 00:45 - Damien Fung: oh speaking of frats, they decided to throw a massive block party but since they have some members in the student union they managed to take over the entire campus for their party
10/04/2022, 00:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A highly sexually charged environment in which men do sex things together, but not specifically for the purpose of having sex with men, just as a show of shared masculine sexual prowess
10/04/2022, 00:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ugh
10/04/2022, 00:46 - Damien Fung: and like they were blasting music so loudly people could feel it through the building walls in their dorms for the entire day
10/04/2022, 00:46 - Patsy Ng: bruh the entire day?
10/04/2022, 00:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Pain
10/04/2022, 00:47 - Damien Fung: even though I'm a 20 min walk away from the party i could still hear it all day with my headphones on
10/04/2022, 00:47 - Damien Fung: bc of the bass
10/04/2022, 00:47 - Damien Fung: and it went from 9am to 10pm
10/04/2022, 00:48 - Damien Fung: it was so bad that professors living in the same area on campus are saying they're considering legal action against the union and frats
10/04/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: what the fudge
10/04/2022, 01:37 - Cindy Yang: wow
10/04/2022, 02:15 - Patsy Ng: HELL YEAH I JUST DID TODAY'S GUARDIAN CROSSWORD ALL MY MYSELF FIRST TRY
10/04/2022, 02:20 - Damien Fung: eyyyyyy
10/04/2022, 02:30 - Patsy Ng: i've kind of wanted to make a guardian account to try talking to the other crossword people for a while now
10/04/2022, 02:30 - Patsy Ng: today seems like. it might be a good day to do so
10/04/2022, 03:11 - Cindy Yang: oo nice
10/04/2022, 03:11 - Cindy Yang: isn’t it mostly old ppl
10/04/2022, 03:11 - Cindy Yang: not that that’s bad
10/04/2022, 03:38 - Patsy Ng: yeah
10/04/2022, 03:38 - Patsy Ng: I want to absorb their crossword experience via osmosis
10/04/2022, 05:38 - Cindy Yang: funky
10/04/2022, 05:39 - Damien Fung: just finished clearing my apartment and man it looks so empty now
10/04/2022, 05:40 - Damien Fung: once the person buying my couch arrives i'm gonna start moving the furniture i'm giving to my friend out and it's gonna be even emptier
10/04/2022, 05:42 - Cindy Yang: watched the sonic movie
10/04/2022, 05:42 - Cindy Yang: wack
10/04/2022, 05:42 - Damien Fung: nice how was it

10/04/2022, 06:27 - Damien Fung: we've pushed out 6 version fixes today alone and it's just to fix this one small bug that shouldn't be there
10/04/2022, 06:27 - Cindy Yang: rip
10/04/2022, 06:27 - Cindy Yang: good luck
10/04/2022, 06:27 - Damien Fung: but each version fix takes 30 mins to deploy and testing takes another few mins
10/04/2022, 06:27 - Damien Fung: so we have like 2 attempts left
10/04/2022, 06:27 - Damien Fung: tyty
10/04/2022, 07:00 - Cindy Yang: how is isabel doin

10/04/2022, 07:42 - Cindy Yang: licked my fork and was like damn this tastes like blood before realizing that it was just. the metal
10/04/2022, 07:55 - Damien Fung: teammate in other group project decided to use his own colour scheme instead of a default
10/04/2022, 07:55 - Damien Fung: and man as a visualization enthusiast it hurt to look at
10/04/2022, 07:55 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>

10/04/2022, 09:29 - Patsy Ng: big mood tho
10/04/2022, 09:31 - Damien Fung: yeah it was really bad. bc my mac has a chipset that is relatively new to market i couldn't do the testing myself and one teammate was getting a medical checkup so we only had 1 guy doing all the testing
10/04/2022, 09:31 - Patsy Ng: ouch
10/04/2022, 09:31 - Patsy Ng: do you not have like. lab pcs
10/04/2022, 09:31 - Patsy Ng: that you ssh into
10/04/2022, 09:31 - Damien Fung: we do but not for this course
10/04/2022, 09:32 - Damien Fung: also i don't have access to them for now since i'm not taking any cs courses
10/04/2022, 09:32 - Patsy Ng: bruh
10/04/2022, 09:32 - Damien Fung: and the thing we were trying to fix was actually a container so that you don't need to use lab pcs to run your code
10/04/2022, 09:33 - Damien Fung: except for the chipset discrepancies

11/04/2022, 09:09 - Cindy Yang: he was trying to help 😔
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Patsy Ng: we have a mini report thing that's meant to be 100-500 words and it's you talking about how you contributed to the project and worked as a team so it all goes in there
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Patsy Ng: anyway update the shitty report writer just texted and now i am having to fucking teach them to write a goddamn report
11/04/2022, 10:18 - Patsy Ng: earlier i asked them to move the tests to the end of the notebook to pretend they were like. in an appendix like they would be in a normal word doc report 

they were like "oh i didn't know tests weren't actually supposed to go in testing"

we've been writing reports for two years by this point!!! and like. i basically wrote the last two but the fact that you didn't even know our tests were in the appendix for both reports tells me you didn't even bother reading it before submitting! i could have told you to submit simlish and you would have done it!!! i would do it if it didn't mean we all fail!!!
11/04/2022, 10:19 - Damien Fung: wait
11/04/2022, 10:19 - Damien Fung: tests *in* the notebook?
11/04/2022, 10:20 - Patsy Ng: yeah i disagree with it but i can't. tell them to dump it all
11/04/2022, 10:21 - Patsy Ng: i did my tests in normal python files using normal python tests like a normal person
11/04/2022, 10:21 - Patsy Ng: but the tests are. for making graphs and it's kind of hard to do unit testing for it
11/04/2022, 10:21 - Damien Fung: nah you can do blackbox testing for that
11/04/2022, 10:22 - Patsy Ng: ooh sounds interesting
11/04/2022, 10:23 - Damien Fung: just plot a few observations and after like 3 the visualization function should be working fine
11/04/2022, 10:24 - Patsy Ng: the graphs. are pie charts and line graphs? don't you kind of need all of the data at once
11/04/2022, 10:24 - Damien Fung: wait yeah how does pytest even work in notebook
11/04/2022, 10:24 - Patsy Ng: nah we can submit regular files as well
11/04/2022, 10:25 - Patsy Ng: just the report is a notebook and it's supposed to be runnable (as in we do analysis in there and then discuss)
11/04/2022, 10:26 - Damien Fung: nah so if it's a pre existing package then it's fine to not test since it already has to go through rigorous testing to become a public package

if you make custom adjustments then you only need the bare minimum to create a visualization test

for a line graph you just need 2 observations to test the line, for a pie chart you just need 1 to create the circle or another to test the partitions
11/04/2022, 10:27 - Patsy Ng: yeah that's basically our tests
11/04/2022, 10:27 - Patsy Ng: plot a rando thing and visually confirm it is a working graph
11/04/2022, 10:28 - Damien Fung: ah yeah that's black box testing
11/04/2022, 10:48 - Patsy Ng: how do i say "i needed to edit these sections of the report that someone else wrote because they weren't coherent and weren't in full sentences, and also weren't grammatically correct" politely and without sounding like grammar nazi
11/04/2022, 10:49 - Tara: I had to edit these sections to make the points clearer?
11/04/2022, 10:50 - Patsy Ng: i love you
11/04/2022, 10:50 - Patsy Ng: for context it's nearly four am and i feel like i've been dying for the last three days
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Tara: Are you almost done
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Patsy Ng: yeah it's due 9 pm tmr
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Patsy Ng: today
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Patsy Ng: but i have Stuff to do tonight (which i planned before we got the extension) so i would like it in by 17:00

11/04/2022, 10:52 - Tara: I hope your gtoupmate perishes
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Patsy Ng: i'm trying my best not to feel that way but i think. it is going to be On Sight after this
11/04/2022, 10:54 - Patsy Ng: our dorms are next to each other (not the same one thankfully) and now whenever i walk past i feel utter seething loathing
11/04/2022, 10:55 - Tara: Curse them somehow
11/04/2022, 10:56 - Patsy Ng: which is dumb because they actually did more stuff than the other person!

so technically they were more useful!

but i have to like. redo some of the stuff they do and explain stuff to them and it's just like. if you're not gonna do it properly then leave me alone so i can do it!
11/04/2022, 10:56 - Tara: As they say
If you want something done well then you gotta do it yourself
11/04/2022, 10:57 - Tara: I don't get useless groupmates
Like do they not realise that they're useless
11/04/2022, 10:57 - Tara: I feel like I should be discouraging this but they're so annoying and idek them
11/04/2022, 10:57 - Patsy Ng: thank you for your moral support
11/04/2022, 10:58 - Tara: oui
11/04/2022, 10:58 - Tara: any time

12/04/2022, 16:55 - Patsy Ng: yeah
12/04/2022, 16:55 - Patsy Ng: also considered "PNGnotJPG" but i guess you actually need to know my name to get those, and github won't show it

12/04/2022, 21:04 - Tara: How are those two parts related
12/04/2022, 21:06 - Patsy Ng: it's a team thing and the other two people are my maths friends

but we've never coded together so we had a practice run to work out how to split stuff up

since 24 hour quiet zone is now being enforced bc it's revision week 1, we went up to the most isolated common room so we could be slightly louder

we had to move the tables around and the tables are old and made of wood
12/04/2022, 21:21 - Tara: I see
12/04/2022, 21:22 - Tara: Are you alright

13/04/2022, 02:51 - Patsy Ng: hmm I think we used apache spark in first year

15/04/2022, 21:03 - Tara: I did finger guns but one at a time once
I was then told to never do that again
15/04/2022, 21:03 - Tara: The heck is that graph though
15/04/2022, 21:06 - Rishibh Prakash: this is for differential equations: you want to say if a solution intersects gamma multiple times then it can only do so in a certain way
15/04/2022, 21:06 - Rishibh Prakash: and instead of proving it formally, you just wave pictures at people's faces
15/04/2022, 21:07 - Tara: Ooh
In the left graph could it be a zigzag or is that the only way
15/04/2022, 21:09 - Rishibh Prakash: the arrows tell you the direction of travel, notice how this means that after you enter C (in the left graph) you must remain there (you also can't cross the line) which means that if we have x(t_3) intersecting gamma again it must do so above x(t_2)
15/04/2022, 21:10 - Rishibh Prakash: a similar argument holds for the right graph so again you get that the third intersection must be above the first two
15/04/2022, 21:11 - Rishibh Prakash: and thats the pattern we're looking for, the intersections always go in one way along gamma
15/04/2022, 21:11 - Rishibh Prakash: you can never have x(t_3) between x(t_2) and x(t_1) for example
15/04/2022, 21:14 - Tara: Ohh
15/04/2022, 21:14 - Tara: Ok
15/04/2022, 21:14 - Tara: I finally get it
15/04/2022, 21:15 - Rishibh Prakash: if you want the complete argument and the surrounding context you can look at the very last part of this: http://individual.utoronto.ca/rishibhp/notes/MAT267.pdf

the theorem itself starts at the end of page 68 but this argument is on page 69 from the first paragraph on that page
15/04/2022, 21:15 - Tara: Ooh are these the notes you're gonna send to your professor
15/04/2022, 21:16 - Rishibh Prakash: yes ma'am
15/04/2022, 21:19 - Tara: very minor thing
under figure 14 did you mean trapped in C
15/04/2022, 21:19 - Rishibh Prakash: yup i did
15/04/2022, 21:19 - Rishibh Prakash: i realised that as i was looking at it rn
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Rishibh Prakash: thanks though!
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Tara: lmao
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Tara: oh np
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Rishibh Prakash: i was originally using D but then i realised that i already used D for something else
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Tara: now that i know you've written this
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Rishibh Prakash: forgot to change that one guy
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Tara: you are a cheeky bastard
15/04/2022, 21:20 - Rishibh Prakash: 😊
15/04/2022, 21:21 - Rishibh Prakash: i mean you _can_ make the argument a bit more formal but the proof of the theorem is already like 3 pages long
15/04/2022, 21:22 - Tara: as a non maths person this is formal enough
15/04/2022, 21:22 - Tara: diagrams >>>
15/04/2022, 21:22 - Rishibh Prakash: idk if i said this but for my topology course last semester, the prof literally said please dont write formulae for the final exam and just draw pictures
15/04/2022, 21:23 - Tara: hahaha
15/04/2022, 21:23 - Tara: tanushree is in shock rn
15/04/2022, 21:23 - Tara: in year 11 she was very against using diagrams in problems
15/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 21:25 - Rishibh Prakash: i mean i understand but sometimes the work to do things without pictures is a bit too much and just hides whats really going on anyway
15/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: i approve
you have a contents page with links
15/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: the maths looks mathsy
15/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: the diagrams look diagrammy
15/04/2022, 21:26 - Rishibh Prakash: thank 🙏
15/04/2022, 21:26 - Tara: are you going to make these sorts of notes for all your classes
15/04/2022, 21:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: when you're trying to multitask at an orgy
15/04/2022, 21:27 - Rishibh Prakash: lmaoooo
15/04/2022, 21:27 - Tara: im gonna read your cs notes
15/04/2022, 21:28 - Tara: now this i understand
15/04/2022, 21:28 - Tara: i no longer feel like a dummy /s
15/04/2022, 21:28 - Tara: i joke i always feel like one
15/04/2022, 21:29 - Tara: oh jeez last time i looked at O(n) was in fall 2020
15/04/2022, 21:29 - Rishibh Prakash: i feel like those cs notes arent as good but that might be because i much prefer math
15/04/2022, 21:30 - Tara: ah
15/04/2022, 21:30 - Tara: well they're still objectively good probably
15/04/2022, 21:31 - Rishibh Prakash: 🙏
15/04/2022, 23:33 - Tara: @447759215825 grew the cowplant
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Tara: looks adorable
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Tara: name: little simzee
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Patsy Ng: send photo
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Patsy Ng: babey! cow!
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Cindy Yang: freaky
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Tara: you should have seen the seed
15/04/2022, 23:34 - Tara: little baby cowplant
15/04/2022, 23:35 - Patsy Ng: why what did the seed look like
15/04/2022, 23:35 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 23:35 - Tara: itty bitty berry
15/04/2022, 23:35 - Patsy Ng: calfplant
15/04/2022, 23:35 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 23:36 - Patsy Ng: aaaa so babey
15/04/2022, 23:36 - Tara: oh lawddddd
15/04/2022, 23:36 - Tara: my sim left for work and
15/04/2022, 23:36 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/04/2022, 23:36 - Tara: bitch imma die
15/04/2022, 23:37 - Patsy Ng: ?
15/04/2022, 23:37 - Tara: if you eat the cake
15/04/2022, 23:37 - Tara: the cowplant eats you
15/04/2022, 23:37 - Patsy Ng: then just don't eat the cake?
15/04/2022, 23:38 - Tara: yeah i did
i thought it wasnt an option
15/04/2022, 23:38 - Tara: and panicked
15/04/2022, 23:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 03:36 - Damien Fung: woah
16/04/2022, 03:36 - Damien Fung: just got a double yolk
16/04/2022, 03:36 - Patsy Ng: slurp it raw
16/04/2022, 03:37 - Patsy Ng: double shot
16/04/2022, 03:37 - Patsy Ng: of salmonella
16/04/2022, 03:37 - Damien Fung: only found out after i cracked it into my pan lol
16/04/2022, 03:37 - Patsy Ng: rip
16/04/2022, 03:43 - Cindy Yang: dang
16/04/2022, 03:43 - Cindy Yang: form it into a heart
16/04/2022, 03:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I have a friend from 🇳🇱 who insists that raw eggs are okay there and I refuse to believe it
16/04/2022, 03:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, sure, they can be as regulated as you like but have you seen eggs
16/04/2022, 03:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think that might just be me not trusting the texture tho, I will happily scarf down uncooked cookie dough
16/04/2022, 03:45 - Damien Fung: I've had a bunch of raw eggs lately
16/04/2022, 03:45 - Damien Fung: mixed with other stuff tho
16/04/2022, 03:46 - Damien Fung: it's fine in Canada but i wouldn't do it back in hk
16/04/2022, 03:46 - Patsy Ng: wait why
16/04/2022, 03:46 - Patsy Ng: it's still an egg
16/04/2022, 03:47 - Damien Fung: each country does their processing differently
16/04/2022, 03:47 - Patsy Ng: hmm i thought the processing was just. cleaning the outside of the egg and whether they chose to fridge the eggs or not
16/04/2022, 03:50 - Damien Fung: https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-consumers/fact-sheets/specific-products-and-risks/dairy-eggs-and-honey/egg-grading/eng/1332271593213/1332271655324

since all the eggs they sell at stores are grade A they're presumably all safe
16/04/2022, 03:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mostly just dislike the texture
16/04/2022, 03:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like
16/04/2022, 03:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: look at them
16/04/2022, 03:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: eggs
16/04/2022, 03:56 - Damien Fung: https://www.seriouseats.com/tamago-kake-gohan-egg-rice-tkg-recipe-breakfast

been making this recipe a lot
16/04/2022, 03:56 - Damien Fung: highly recommend
16/04/2022, 03:56 - Patsy Ng: that's not raw egg tho right

it gets cooked when you mix it into the hot rice
16/04/2022, 03:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeean
16/04/2022, 03:57 - Damien Fung: not hot enough to kill all bacteria
16/04/2022, 03:57 - Patsy Ng: fair
16/04/2022, 03:57 - Patsy Ng: i used to eat it loads in hk tho so if you're counting that as raw egg then [insert lenny]
16/04/2022, 03:58 - Damien Fung: why the lenny lol
16/04/2022, 03:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: okay time to figure out which bits I have on hand

- rice duh
- can buy eggs
- soy sauce duh
- wtf is mirin
- salt yes
- msg yes
- idk what hondashi is
- furikake yes
- nori can do

sweet, I shall make
16/04/2022, 03:58 - Patsy Ng: your thing about not eating raw eggs in hk
16/04/2022, 03:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: as long as it doesn't taste like raw egg feels
16/04/2022, 03:59 - Damien Fung: maybe it's the brand of eggs
16/04/2022, 04:00 - Damien Fung: since a lot of it's imported it might be hard to tell what processing they did to the eggs
16/04/2022, 04:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh hondashi is just seaweed soup stock? i can probably do that
16/04/2022, 04:00 - Damien Fung: if it's from japan i'll be cool with it tho
16/04/2022, 04:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: mirin... might be fun to substitute soju
16/04/2022, 04:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, I wanna buy some soju or equivalent rice wine for cooking but I think the flatmates would drink it
16/04/2022, 04:02 - Patsy Ng: they'd just drink your stuff without asking?
16/04/2022, 04:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: My chopping board is currently under a massive pile of washing up
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They have even gone to the effort of
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: learning how to use chopsticks while I was away
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so that they can use and not wash half of my chopsticks
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because they are out of spoons and forks
16/04/2022, 04:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: because they refuse to wash those
16/04/2022, 04:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which is actually why I *bought* the chopsticks, because they mean I always have something I can use because white people are more likely to wash their dishes than attempt to eat with these
16/04/2022, 04:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: anyway, I famously do not drink (except when I do, how exciting!) so they might not realise it was mine and drink it
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Patsy Ng: yo your flatmates are awful
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: whatever
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they;re fine
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: they just
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: party a lot
16/04/2022, 04:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which is inconvenient
16/04/2022, 04:07 - Cindy Yang: yikes
16/04/2022, 04:07 - Cindy Yang: how did they assign you
16/04/2022, 04:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i have no idea
16/04/2022, 04:10 - Damien Fung: can you just store your stuff in your room?
16/04/2022, 04:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: occasionally I do
16/04/2022, 04:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: in any case it;'s kinda
16/04/2022, 04:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: whatever
16/04/2022, 04:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: bought a wok in anticipation of movintg out because my place for next year has a gas stove
16/04/2022, 04:12 - Damien Fung: nice nice
16/04/2022, 04:12 - Damien Fung: don't forget to season it
16/04/2022, 04:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah ik
16/04/2022, 04:13 - Damien Fung: i seasoned the hell out of my cast iron
16/04/2022, 04:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's one of those woks with the kinda flat-ish base so in theory it might be usable on induction if I could get somebody to season on gas
16/04/2022, 04:14 - Damien Fung: never need a non stick ever again
16/04/2022, 04:14 - Damien Fung: can't you just use an oven?
16/04/2022, 04:14 - Damien Fung: also induction should work too
16/04/2022, 04:15 - Damien Fung: bc seasoning's just forcing the oil to reach smoking point and cooling down again to polymerize the surface
16/04/2022, 04:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh perhaps
16/04/2022, 04:15 - Damien Fung: and induction actually does that better since it's a lot faster
16/04/2022, 04:18 - Patsy Ng: "season on gas"?? what does that even mean
16/04/2022, 04:18 - Damien Fung: use fire to season the wok
16/04/2022, 04:18 - Patsy Ng: i get seasoning the wok but why on earth would you season gas
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: to season the wok on a gas burner because on induction you're only getting heat where the metal contacts the glass
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Patsy Ng: ah
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Damien Fung: i mean it's still metal??????? heat spreads evenly
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Damien Fung: well after a while but yeah still spreads
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: idk that's what I'm reading
16/04/2022, 04:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the ladies in chinatown were very insistent that it be done on a gas cooker
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Damien Fung: induction stoves can get a lot hotter a lot faster too
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Patsy Ng: i think the heat type is diff
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: heat is heat
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: it's about distribution
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Patsy Ng: like how steamy heat is different from frying heat from boiling heat from oven heat
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think presumably you would want the flames licking the side of the wok
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: steamy heat isn't different for heat reasons, it's different because there's water involved
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Patsy Ng: fine
16/04/2022, 04:20 - Patsy Ng: but the other heats
16/04/2022, 04:21 - Damien Fung: i mean you're not cooking with the outside of the wok
16/04/2022, 04:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: fair
16/04/2022, 04:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think like
16/04/2022, 04:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: with gas presumably you would have heat travelling up the sides via the flames, the air etc

induction the heat is entirely underneath the vessel so you have to wait for it to move up the actual metal
16/04/2022, 04:22 - Damien Fung: the main condition for polymerization is that your wok is hot enough to push the oil to smoking point
16/04/2022, 04:23 - Damien Fung: since the induction stove can reach higher temperatures it's almost guaranteed that your entire wok will be hot enough to season
16/04/2022, 04:23 - Damien Fung: it's definitely gonna be hotter in the center
16/04/2022, 04:23 - Damien Fung: but that's the same for all stoves
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Damien Fung: but at the end of the day it still seasons
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Damien Fung: as long as you don't melt off the seasoning you should be good
16/04/2022, 04:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: based
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: having somebody who actually cooks in the group chat is chef's kiss
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Patsy Ng: wait martin did you cart a wok all the way back to swansea from london chinatown
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yes
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: a smallish one that barely fit in my backpack tho
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Damien Fung: dude i've been nerding out about kitchen gear for the past month lol. i have mastered the art of kitchen care
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah i told one of my friends here about the "pancake" we made over new year
16/04/2022, 04:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: that's gonna be me once I don't live in a student flat
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: thinking sinful thoughts about japanese water boilers
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Damien Fung: wait what did y'all do
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh i think it's better if you don't know
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Patsy Ng: we sent a picture here
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Damien Fung: might've been asleep
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Damien Fung: or drunk
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Damien Fung: either or
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lol
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: okay so
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: we had tried to make meringue
16/04/2022, 04:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: with pat using a fork to whip the egg white
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but it didn't really work
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: so then I suggestef
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: we try and fry
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: the egg white
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Patsy Ng: bc i'd made loads the previous day, successfully, using only a fork and two hours of whipping time
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Damien Fung: how tf
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and then pearl's friend, after tasting the cursed egg white and sugar
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: decided to add some flour and it became genuinely good pancakes
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Damien Fung: what workout routine are you doing to be able to hand whip using a fork
16/04/2022, 04:27 - Damien Fung: yum
16/04/2022, 04:28 - Patsy Ng: it didn't work bc we "ran out" of lemons (the last one was hiding in the back of the fridge and we didn't find it till the next morning)

so we tried adding lemonade instead

and when that didn't work we tried apple juice
16/04/2022, 04:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no wonder!
16/04/2022, 04:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: do lemons make hand whipping meringue easier?
16/04/2022, 04:28 - Patsy Ng: they make the whipping hold its shape
16/04/2022, 04:28 - Patsy Ng: without it you just get really foamy egg whites
16/04/2022, 04:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: my mum is saying it would be really difficult to get me home for summer
16/04/2022, 04:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: how are plans going for you guys
16/04/2022, 04:37 - Damien Fung: everything's ready
16/04/2022, 04:37 - Damien Fung: except for the PCR test booking
16/04/2022, 04:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: okay I am reading the wok instructions
16/04/2022, 04:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Need to remove coating first by putting on full heat apparently
16/04/2022, 04:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't think it specifies what sort of cooker for this stage so I'm gonna go try and do that in the kitchen
16/04/2022, 04:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 04:58 - Damien Fung: ye just keep on repositioning it
16/04/2022, 04:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: When you say repositioning
16/04/2022, 04:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: As in holding it sideways?
16/04/2022, 04:59 - Damien Fung: yessir
16/04/2022, 04:59 - Damien Fung: like after you're done with the initial stages of seasoning you won't have to do this again
16/04/2022, 05:00 - Damien Fung: bc if you're using a wok you're gonna be moving it around a lot such that the heat's gonna be evenly distributed
16/04/2022, 05:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Hoping the fire alarm won't go off rn lol
16/04/2022, 05:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Starting to see why gas - induction works from physical contact, so a round edge is more difficult to hold against the stove
16/04/2022, 05:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Gonna give it a break for a while because flat kitchen is absurdly badly ventilated and it's a miracle I've not set off a fire alarm considering the quality of air I'm now breathing
16/04/2022, 05:05 - Damien Fung: yeah that's the main caveat of induction
16/04/2022, 05:05 - Damien Fung: but since a wok is made of cast iron it holds heat super well
16/04/2022, 05:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I wonder if this bit could be done by oven 🤔
16/04/2022, 05:05 - Damien Fung: yes!
16/04/2022, 05:05 - Damien Fung: seasoning is the easiest in an oven
16/04/2022, 05:06 - Damien Fung: turn it to 400f and just leave it in there for an hour
16/04/2022, 05:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's not the seasoning bit yet, just dealing with the lacquer they sold it in
16/04/2022, 05:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which the packaging says ought to be either burned off or scrubbed very thoroughly
16/04/2022, 05:06 - Damien Fung: let it cool then apply a coat of oil which is so thin you're gonna think there isn't any oil and put it upside down
16/04/2022, 05:07 - Damien Fung: ah
16/04/2022, 05:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 05:24 - Patsy Ng: could you try the scrubbing method then
16/04/2022, 05:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: cba
16/04/2022, 05:25 - Patsy Ng: but you _can_ be arsed to hold and rotate it on the induction stove while torturing your lungs
16/04/2022, 06:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ovening is not working
16/04/2022, 06:04 - Damien Fung: did you heat it to 400f?
16/04/2022, 06:04 - Damien Fung: upside down
16/04/2022, 06:04 - Damien Fung: as in the wok
16/04/2022, 06:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Good point about putting it upside down
16/04/2022, 06:39 - Cindy Yang: where r u guys staying for next year
16/04/2022, 06:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
16/04/2022, 06:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Decided to take it out before the wood handle became charcoal
16/04/2022, 06:51 - Cindy Yang: damn
16/04/2022, 06:52 - Cindy Yang: 🙏
16/04/2022, 06:58 - Damien Fung: eyyyyy
16/04/2022, 06:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Probs gonna need real fire to finish it before baking 2.0 but it's progress
16/04/2022, 06:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That's the lacquer browned but not fully burned off I think
16/04/2022, 08:17 - Cindy Yang: we had a quiz in math and we’ve been doing probability and a guy in my class asked what it means when events are independent
16/04/2022, 08:44 - Cindy Yang: like bruh have u been payin attention
16/04/2022, 08:45 - Damien Fung: wtf

17/04/2022, 02:03 - Patsy Ng: ooof
17/04/2022, 02:03 - Patsy Ng: fingers crossed it's not covid tho
17/04/2022, 02:03 - Patsy Ng: i'd ask if you'd done an ltf but. those aren't remarkably great at detecting the early days
17/04/2022, 02:08 - Cindy Yang: mm
17/04/2022, 02:10 - Cindy Yang: idk where to get a test myself but i messaged student health
17/04/2022, 02:10 - Cindy Yang: dunno if they’ll get back to me anytime soon tho
17/04/2022, 02:10 - Patsy Ng: wacko

17/04/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: why do you require help
17/04/2022, 22:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: PCR is too sensitive in the weeks following infection so do a latty first
17/04/2022, 22:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
17/04/2022, 23:06 - Tara: oh i dont

17/04/2022, 23:36 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
18/04/2022, 00:09 - Patsy Ng: huh your tests are Weird
18/04/2022, 00:10 - Patsy Ng: is the cardboard thing part of the thing you drop your snot on or is it like. a comparison instruction thing that has a fun little viewing slot on top which you've placed on for photographing convenience
18/04/2022, 00:13 - Cindy Yang: it’s like a card that u open with one side that u put the swab on and the other side has the little strip with the lines
18/04/2022, 00:14 - Cindy Yang: and then u close the card so the swab contacts the strip
18/04/2022, 00:26 - Patsy Ng: wacko
18/04/2022, 00:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
18/04/2022, 01:00 - Patsy Ng: what are you gonna season it with
18/04/2022, 01:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oil
18/04/2022, 01:01 - Damien Fung: vegetable oil has a super low smoking point so use that
18/04/2022, 01:01 - Damien Fung: of you happen to have any fats from meats just lying around that works even better. forgot the science for that one tho
18/04/2022, 01:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's become important that I have a good wok soon because the non-stick on my cheap-ass Wilko pans is becoming non-viable
18/04/2022, 01:02 - Damien Fung: I'd say keep that around if you're working with anything acidic bc that's gonna strip off the seasoning
18/04/2022, 01:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Eh, my old shit is bent and burned by now because

- bad at cooking
- shit tier quality
18/04/2022, 01:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But yeah I'm gonna get a metal IKEA pot for

22/04/2022, 19:00 - Tara: That's a very long sentence
22/04/2022, 19:01 - Tara: What does it mean oml
22/04/2022, 19:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk
22/04/2022, 19:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay I think what they are trying to say is
22/04/2022, 19:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: - there was a move
    - from thinking of social relations as structured by capital in the same way everywhere
    - to a view of relations & hegemony (what has power over what) as affected by a range of factors

This brought
    - the question of temporality (how does time affect things)
Into
    - the thinking of structure (discourse about the way society is put together)

This also marked a shift
from
     - A form of althusserian theory (the way Althusser thought of society) that

... And I'm lost
22/04/2022, 19:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay so all this marks a shift from

- theory that thinks of structure as this thing that just exists

- to theory that thinks of structure as dependent on time and place and other things
22/04/2022, 19:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Basically what Butler is saying is that people used to think of the way society is structured and the way people relate to each other as this thing that just exists, but now they think of it as dependent on what's going on, where, when, and between who
22/04/2022, 19:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But like... You could have just said that
22/04/2022, 19:13 - Tara: Bruh

but the skin _stretched_ so much it was wild
01/05/2022, 19:38 - Patsy Ng: also there was a toddler throwing sticks at the ducks and the mom hadn't noticed bc she was chasing her other baby, who was chasing the ducks, and i like. involuntarily shouted "NO!" at the toddler
01/05/2022, 19:39 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
01/05/2022, 19:39 - Tara: stretched??

04/05/2022, 00:21 - Patsy Ng: i'm so fucking tired trying to sort out covid test + vaccine proof stuff for going back to hk and every time i try and gain access to my nhs records i'm met with a "sorry we can't find your records" binch please why are there so many hoops i had to wait like. six months to even find out my chi number bc the registering procedure was "email us and if we don't reply, assume you were successful" so there was like. no way for me to get the number apart from being like "hey could i have my chi number please"
04/05/2022, 00:36 - Cindy Yang: o dear
04/05/2022, 02:26 - Damien Fung: uk moment
04/05/2022, 09:56 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Nice!!
04/05/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Good way to end your sem
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: Also may I share a dream
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: It's really gross
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: And I hate it
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: And I want to throw up a bit
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Damien Fung: eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i p much got that too
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: Too late I'm sharing it
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Cindy Yang: sure
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: I.e. forwarding stuff because I don't want to type it again
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Cindy Yang: yeee
04/05/2022, 09:57 - Cindy Yang: oke
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: Bro help I had a dream I ate a baby
The texture was like fish but I almost threw up eating the head so I gave it to mother or Simran idk
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: Then I played bowling with people and I won
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: The worst part is that whenever people came over to my grandfather's house (because I was living there) I would ask if they tried eating a baby
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: The head
It's crunchy
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: In my previous dreams I've seen decapitation
And that was not as bad as this
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: Oh!! I have just realised why I dreamt about it
I was listening to a podcast about this fella in the 30s who used to abduct children and occasionally eat them
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: The serial killer's name was Arthur Fish
04/05/2022, 09:58 - Tara: Simran isn't WIS Simran she studies at CUHK
04/05/2022, 09:59 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:59 - Cindy Yang: damn
04/05/2022, 12:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: w
04/05/2022, 16:25 - Damien Fung: damn once again i'm like just barely under the deans list
04/05/2022, 19:03 - Patsy Ng: didn't you have your exams like. a week ago

how did the dean's list come out so quickly
04/05/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm so annoyed
04/05/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm doing some coursework which involves submitting a certain amount of creative work and then a reflection on your writing and editing and rewriting process
04/05/2022, 19:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and they're like
04/05/2022, 19:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "Provide a short piece of creative work. You can write fiction, or a drama, screenplay, or a poetry portfolio"
04/05/2022, 19:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But specifically they require over 1.5k words
04/05/2022, 19:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Think about how long poems usually are
04/05/2022, 19:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And how much more dense the language is than, say, a short story
04/05/2022, 19:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 1.5k words is 10% of all the sonnets Shakespeare ever wrote. 1.5k words of dialogue is a quarter of a feature film.
04/05/2022, 19:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They _clearly_ designed the coursework for book writers and then tacked "oh poets can do it too I guess"
04/05/2022, 19:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: *tacked on
04/05/2022, 19:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm so angry about it rn lol
04/05/2022, 19:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For fifteen-hundred pounds
I might fly from Cardiff to Amsterdam and back twenty-eight times
with enough left over to plant three hundred trees
and offset eight tonnes of carbon emissions,
or buy nine kilograms of loose-leaf Oolong tea
shipped from the high mountains of Taiwan
and with it, brew twenty-three thousand three-hundred mililitre mugs.

And with fifteen hundred minutes,
I might spend a day on leisure,
and still have time to sleep an hour more.
With fifteen-hundred hours
I might add another month between April and May
and spend it drawing blood from a stone.

Alas, I haven’t the money, minutes, or hours,
and I find myself with a glut of words instead.

With fifteen-hundred words,
I might write a tenth of Shakespeare’s sonnets,
Fifteen tens of twelve lines
published fifty years after his feet first touched the stage,
or two chapters of Genesis,
and invent the heavens and the earth,
flowers, food, and sex.

In nineteen sixty seven, fifteen thousand words
gave James Bond six hundred lines,
two countries, two women,
two lives and one death,
a dastardly scheme to destabilise the international balance of power and escalate the cold war, the massive international implications of which cannot be understated and would doubtless lead to human extinction and nuclear winter,
a murphy bed, a submarine, and a private metro train.

But I haven’t got the years to be Shakespeare
nor the power to create in seven days,
and I’ve certainly no interest in being James Bond.
What am I to do with all these words?
04/05/2022, 19:42 - Patsy Ng: ooh nice
04/05/2022, 19:43 - Patsy Ng: basically you wrote this to be petty and snark at the examiners about their ridiculous poem length requirements?
04/05/2022, 19:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: even then it's barely helping
04/05/2022, 19:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I had wanted to finally put tohgether my portfolio of tea poems
04/05/2022, 19:43 - Patsy Ng: is it actually 1500 words tho
04/05/2022, 19:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no i need to write like twenty poems to make the length
04/05/2022, 19:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: and I have
04/05/2022, 19:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: three hours left
04/05/2022, 19:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm only halfway done
04/05/2022, 19:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I had thought "Three days is easily enough for 1.5k words"
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: ooof
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Patsy Ng: are you allowed to do loads of poems or do you have to make a single epic
04/05/2022, 19:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm supposed to do loads of poems
04/05/2022, 19:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: but for context
04/05/2022, 19:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That would be fifteen to twenty poems
04/05/2022, 19:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Fifteen in the case of, for example, a sonnet, which is already really longish
04/05/2022, 19:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And twenty+ for anything less than twelve lines each
04/05/2022, 20:14 - Tara: jesus and you have to write 15-20 of these?
04/05/2022, 20:14 - Tara: wait how many words is tht
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no this one;'s really long on purpose
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would have to write six of that
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: ah and are you going to submit it with everything else
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: ok you know what
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: i will leave you
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: you have three hours
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: go
04/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: i beleaf in you
04/05/2022, 20:44 - Cindy Yang: damn
04/05/2022, 20:44 - Cindy Yang: good luck
04/05/2022, 21:03 - Patsy Ng: is there any leeway for the length req

like are you allowed to do +- 10%

so like. 1350 words instead
04/05/2022, 21:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That's not at all better
04/05/2022, 21:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think given that it's a span (1.5-1.7) there is probably no leeway
04/05/2022, 22:07 - Tara: Hhhhh bros
The speedway diner has permanently closed
04/05/2022, 22:07 - Tara: Fudge me
04/05/2022, 23:53 - Patsy Ng: o o f
05/05/2022, 00:19 - Patsy Ng: gonna scream flight details have changed again to 28th may

meaning i have to find an airbnb somewhere bc we get kicked out of dorms on the 21st
@447380604852 any chance you wanna meet up in london and finally visit some museums together
05/05/2022, 00:45 - Tara: Aw no that's annoying
05/05/2022, 00:46 - Tara: What museums do you want to visit
05/05/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Also I'm sorry but sibling sent me a compilation of whatever crap is happening in the Amber Heard trial and jebus I hate her lawyers so much 
It's also mildly entertaining
05/05/2022, 00:46 - Patsy Ng: sibling dearest took me to the v&a on the first day and then i spent three hours in one room so we ended up agreeing to not do any museums together

so basically everything
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Every time he tried talking her lawyers would say Objection Hearsay
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: What does that even mean
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: What's v&a
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Patsy Ng: wait tara were you planning to come to london

or did that change to istanbul
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Patsy Ng: victoria and albert museum
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: O
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Yes I'll be there in July
05/05/2022, 00:47 - Tara: Istanbul is a stopover
05/05/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: i'm trying to avoid all mantions of it bc it's just. rich people drama

and if they were just regular people no one would care, so like. they can keep it private
05/05/2022, 00:48 - Patsy Ng: rip
05/05/2022, 00:48 - Tara: I tried very hard too but ahxkajx
05/05/2022, 00:48 - Tara: Why she gotta send me videos
I spent an hour watching them
05/05/2022, 00:48 - Tara: What a waste of time
05/05/2022, 00:49 - Tara: Speaking of I should probably sleep
05/05/2022, 00:49 - Tara: Goodnight
05/05/2022, 00:49 - Tara: And good luck finding accommodation
05/05/2022, 00:51 - Patsy Ng: gnight
05/05/2022, 01:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Sorry, out of town on the 28th!
05/05/2022, 01:39 - Patsy Ng: wacko

doesn't have to be 28th tho, any time from 22-27 would be good (flight is 10 am on 28)
05/05/2022, 01:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Will check!
05/05/2022, 03:15 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah @447380604852 are your poems in now and can we read them
05/05/2022, 03:42 - Damien Fung: it's just based on your scores. if your average is 80%+ then you're on the dean's list
05/05/2022, 03:48 - Damien Fung: fair but i feel like by streaming the trial it spreads awareness that abuse can go either way in a relationship? like usually stuff like this gets automatically shrugged off for regular people relationships
05/05/2022, 05:32 - Rishibh Prakash: spent a good proportion of the day lying in a hammock and reading
05/05/2022, 05:32 - Rishibh Prakash: twas a vibe and a half
05/05/2022, 05:45 - Damien Fung: oooooooooo
05/05/2022, 06:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: nah I just gave up basically and padded for space by adding sidebars explaining content and context
05/05/2022, 06:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: although I did end with a short poem
05/05/2022, 06:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: *It is 4PM*

06/05/2022, 17:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Their tonkatsu blows British katsu out of the water (actually made of pork)
06/05/2022, 17:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: On account of tonkatsu originally being a Japanese interpretation of German food anyway
06/05/2022, 17:33 - Patsy Ng: oh wacko tell me more
06/05/2022, 17:33 - Cindy Yang: oh that’s cool

06/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: o wait wrong message response
06/05/2022, 17:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It is impossible to get pork cutlet in the UK
06/05/2022, 17:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or pork anything that isn't sausage
06/05/2022, 17:34 - Patsy Ng: huh wack
06/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: damn
06/05/2022, 17:34 - Patsy Ng: i thought my hall canteen was just. being weird
06/05/2022, 17:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh?
06/05/2022, 17:35 - Patsy Ng: like i noticed the lack of pork apart from in sausages and bacon but i didn't think it was reflective of the wider uk
06/05/2022, 17:35 - Tara: even in asian restaurants or
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Cindy Yang: id tjere a rszodn
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Patsy Ng: think i've had pork dumplings in london but i'm not sure bc that was last september

06/05/2022, 17:36 - Cindy Yang: damn
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Cindy Yang: reason
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Tara: ah
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Tara: i thought you were going through some turbulence oops
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Cindy Yang: spanish keyboard has the ñ at the end of the middle row throws my typing out of wack
06/05/2022, 17:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's not like they hate pork or anything it's just that
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They don't appear to have any other pork dishes
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That are not sausage or bacon
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Patsy Ng: wait aren't pork pies a uk thing
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Cindy Yang: damn
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And white ppl don't actually know what tonkatsu is
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: When it got brought over it was made with chicken and now British ppl just expect chicken from katsu curry and the like
06/05/2022, 17:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bc chicken is cheaper
06/05/2022, 17:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And nobody will complain if they don't know
06/05/2022, 17:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I guess that too
06/05/2022, 17:38 - Cindy Yang: very wack
06/05/2022, 17:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was googling about this actually and I saw a Reddit thread where these ppl were like "If I open a tonkatsu restaurant and use pork will people even eat it?"
06/05/2022, 17:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: People in the UK that is
06/05/2022, 17:40 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
06/05/2022, 17:41 - Patsy Ng: that's so weird tho

couldn't it just be considered a diff version of tonkatsu

like there's lamb curry and there's chicken curry but they are very much both still curries
06/05/2022, 17:42 - Cindy Yang: alright landing goodbye friends
06/05/2022, 17:42 - Patsy Ng: farewell
06/05/2022, 17:44 - Tara: bye hope you're negative
06/05/2022, 17:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's just "katsu"
06/05/2022, 17:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: As opposed to tonkatsu
06/05/2022, 17:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bc ton means pork
06/05/2022, 17:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And that's how it's marketed
06/05/2022, 17:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But it's notable bc the dish as it is served in Japan and Korea is predominantly made with pork
06/05/2022, 17:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because pork is eaten a lot more in Asia
06/05/2022, 17:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But westernised Japanese restaurants need to sell what ppl will eat, and British ppl are used to chicken I guess
06/05/2022, 17:48 - Patsy Ng: far out
06/05/2022, 20:09 - Cindy Yang: wack

08/05/2022, 01:54 - Patsy Ng: i am going to kill something

trying to book a pcr test at boots for getting back to hk and their store just says "results typically available by midnight the day after your test has been performed" but that's so goddy ambiguous

like do you mean 00:00 as midnight, so like. if you test at midday, you get it back within 12 hours, or basically 23:59, so you get it back within 36 hours???
08/05/2022, 01:55 - Patsy Ng: and like. the phone lines shut at 17:00 today and there's no service on sundays, and the email submission box isn't working, and the virtual assistant is useless and also only works on firefox for some reason
08/05/2022, 01:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I imagine it means you add one to the day your test was performed and then you take midnight of that day
08/05/2022, 01:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is generally accepted to be the minute that comes after 23:59 of that day rather than the one that comes before 00:01
08/05/2022, 01:57 - Patsy Ng: ok Fun
08/05/2022, 02:01 - Patsy Ng: oh also while people are on

@everyone who's had covid recently

08/05/2022, 02:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm telling my mum that she needs to keep me in place until June 15 at least on account of needing to move my shit into the new place
08/05/2022, 02:03 - Patsy Ng: yeah i was doing the maths for mine earlier and by the 28th it'll just have been a month and a day after i got out of isolation

08/05/2022, 18:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 1
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Black and white in this case is too heavy handed
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Damien Fung: but i really hate b&w photos
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Damien Fung: 90% of the time
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: dope
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It creates distance from the subject emotionally speaking and it kinda feels like
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's only b&w because people think b&w = sad
08/05/2022, 18:08 - Tara: nooo

08/05/2022, 18:09 - Tara: also 1
08/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: mainly bc they're just a crutch to lazily cover up flaws
08/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: nah I think it works well with colour
08/05/2022, 18:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
08/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: I've found that less contrast usually looks more pleasing
08/05/2022, 18:10 - Patsy Ng: i have photos of two more dead birds and one unidentified dead mammal (it's basically just bone fragments but going by the teeth it might be some sort of rat (unidentified bc the teeth we think match are from a rat that only lives in south africa))
08/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: wait you analyzed the bones?
08/05/2022, 18:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: We being you and your bestie at uni right
08/05/2022, 18:10 - Patsy Ng: there were these diving birds that we saw but couldn't identify

08/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: i was expecting less blood
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Currently vibing in Belgium in the house of a friend with a much bigger library than I
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Patsy Ng: you know what's really annoying
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 100% rat
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: what do you think killed it
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: a bird?
08/05/2022, 18:12 - Patsy Ng: i have really nicely composed photos of the second dead bird (it's in the death pose with it's neck contorted back and you can see its spine and it's wonderfully bloody) but my fucking thumb is in the corner of all the photos
08/05/2022, 18:13 - Damien Fung: o o f
08/05/2022, 18:13 - Patsy Ng: so i'm gonna have to like. airbrush my thumb out so the photos can be nice

08/05/2022, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: pictures of old anywhere are cool

08/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: is it actually closing tho? i thought it was just. it _might_ close but it can still be saved if the govt props it up or sth

she forced me to sit in the lower deck
08/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: ive never sat on the lower deck
08/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: it was an Experience
08/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: which i will not repeat tyvm
08/05/2022, 18:23 - Damien Fung: pose away from the camera and look like we're in a 2007 garage rock album cover
08/05/2022, 18:23 - Patsy Ng: my parents occasionally made us sit on the lower deck when we were little to keep us humble
08/05/2022, 18:24 - Tara: oop
08/05/2022, 18:24 - Tara: i just assumed top deck == lower deck in terms of design
08/05/2022, 18:24 - Tara: even though you can tell from the outside that's not the case
08/05/2022, 18:24 - Damien Fung: oh wait did i tell y'all I'm gonna apply for an international driver's license so we can probably do a drive around too if y'all want
08/05/2022, 18:24 - Patsy Ng: ooo cool
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: people who sit on the top deck will be the first ones to be annexed during the revolution /s
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Patsy Ng: even if you didn't get it, meri or tara could drive us 👀
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: aw im getting mine in july sorry
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: and i wont be there
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Patsy Ng: oh right
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Patsy Ng: fun
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Damien Fung: aren't there restrictions with the p plate thingy?
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: merilyn can once she figures out how to exit the carpark
08/05/2022, 18:25 - Patsy Ng: are you allowed to drive people around on a learner's license?
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: how do you feel about sibling joining us
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: that's the only way this is gonna happen
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Damien Fung: might convert to full HK license if they let me
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: yep gotta have that on + someone with a full license
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Patsy Ng: would change the vibe but we've hung out with her before i think and it went ok
08/05/2022, 18:26 - Damien Fung: damn that's rough
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Damien Fung: ^
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Tara: hmm it would probably not
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Patsy Ng: not go ok or not change the vibe?
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Damien Fung: big gamble bc idk how the transfer works with my BC license
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Tara: not change the vibe? i think
08/05/2022, 18:27 - Patsy Ng: wacko
08/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: if not then we can invite her friend and they can vibe together
08/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: like in december her friends + my friends went bowling together
08/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: and it was fine
08/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: i came in second place
08/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: actually
08/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: merilyn gets her license before me
08/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: so the best thing would be me driving with her as the full license person
08/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: if she doesnt feel comfortable yet
08/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: furthest ive driven is to repulse bay
08/05/2022, 18:30 - Damien Fung: driving long distance ain't too bad tbh
08/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: the problem is that i cannot deal with noise so if i ask yall to be quiet during some parts of it i apologise
08/05/2022, 18:30 - Patsy Ng: dope
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Patsy Ng: wait would we all fit in one car
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: no
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: two cars!
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: wait that wouldnt work
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: it could actually
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Damien Fung: aw man i had that problem until i was moving. once i had my plates and cutlery in the back in the same box man noise just didn't matter anymore
08/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: ah maybe i should do that
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Damien Fung: also also
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Damien Fung: completely forgot to tell you guys
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Tara: it's just like windy roads are hard
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Patsy Ng: bro you didn't like. wrap the plates + cutlery up so they wouldn't rattle and potentially smash?
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Damien Fung: so i was leaving campus with my friend in the passenger seat
08/05/2022, 18:32 - Damien Fung: and the guy in front of us also had an N (same license level as me rn)
08/05/2022, 18:33 - Damien Fung: and like the forest separating campus and the city has a p long easy road
08/05/2022, 18:33 - Damien Fung: so you'd find it p straightforward to drive on
08/05/2022, 18:33 - Damien Fung: but the person hit the curb somehow and their car got some p good airtime
08/05/2022, 18:34 - Damien Fung: they landed fine but still. interesting experience
08/05/2022, 18:34 - Patsy Ng: wow
08/05/2022, 18:34 - Damien Fung: also no bc i was lazy

08/05/2022, 18:35 - Patsy Ng: it is i hate it
08/05/2022, 18:35 - Tara: yes it doesn't suit you
08/05/2022, 18:36 - Patsy Ng: but i am restricted to the six emojis that whatsapp thought were useful reactions
08/05/2022, 18:36 - Tara: 👎👎

08/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: since you have biometrics instead of just the 3 digits on the back of the card

08/05/2022, 18:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh I have Complaints about the three digits on the back of my card
08/05/2022, 18:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They're the most "dawg you're gonna be hacked" combination possible
08/05/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, surely a competent number generator ought to have blacklisted them
08/05/2022, 18:49 - Patsy Ng: 123
08/05/2022, 18:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 001
08/05/2022, 18:49 - Patsy Ng: ouch
08/05/2022, 18:51 - Patsy Ng: oh for one of our web assignments last term we had to make a website for an online shop with credit card details and stuff and we had to like. test it

and on the spec sheet they had to write "please do not use your real credit card information!!!"

and i wonder if anyone actually did input their actual credit card info

like i typed mine in reflexively but never actually ever got round to hitting enter
08/05/2022, 19:51 - Cindy Yang: woof ended up sleeping basically the whole day
08/05/2022, 19:54 - Patsy Ng: blame it on jetlag
08/05/2022, 19:54 - Cindy Yang: yea
08/05/2022, 19:55 - Cindy Yang: felt fine yesterday tho
08/05/2022, 19:55 - Cindy Yang: slept the whole night
08/05/2022, 19:56 - Cindy Yang: maybe im catching up on sleep debt lmao
08/05/2022, 20:00 - Tara: BBC News - Ncuti Gatwa: BBC names actor as next Doctor Who
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61371123
08/05/2022, 20:06 - Patsy Ng: yee just read that!
08/05/2022, 20:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah, I just twote about this!
08/05/2022, 20:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think it's a good casting decision
08/05/2022, 20:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: New showrunner is RTD who did the 9 and 10 eras
08/05/2022, 20:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like, the casting of the 14th doctor is important
08/05/2022, 20:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If he had gone for a white dude it would have looked like the show was going back to what worked in 2005 to appease people who hate Jodie Whittaker
08/05/2022, 20:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But Ncuti Gatwa is a good pick for the role in a general sense (criterion A) and will piss off the same kinds of people who hate Whittaker (criterion B)
08/05/2022, 20:09 - Patsy Ng: i've never seen ncuti gatwa in anything so idk about a but yeah def meets b
08/05/2022, 20:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For Davies to use the showrunner slot to promote an up and coming minority actor and basically force the BBC to promote him for at least three years is a huge W
08/05/2022, 20:10 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bc it's kind of been clear that there's lots of goodwill for Gatwa in queer and POC spaces since Sex Education but to put him on Doctor Who removes that ceiling from his career and makes him a star with the general public as well
08/05/2022, 20:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's exactly what the show & Gatwa both need rn
08/05/2022, 20:48 - Cindy Yang: nice
08/05/2022, 22:17 - Tara: https://twitter.com/RAINBOWFlSH
oh my god??

09/05/2022, 15:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lots of places give funding to ppl who also take on some teaching duties
09/05/2022, 15:42 - Damien Fung: yeah TAing works
09/05/2022, 15:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That's my plan personally
09/05/2022, 15:42 - Damien Fung: it's usually expected too
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm doing a certification as an English teacher next term as part of my degree
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which will make me CELTA certified to teach English overseas
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which will prove I am a good candidate to teach stuff
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Damien Fung: i might pay out of pocket too just to build up more credit
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Damien Fung: actually nah both should be fine
09/05/2022, 15:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And therefore make it easier to get funding hopefully

Also because that way I can make money tutoring in Hong Kong over summers!
09/05/2022, 15:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bc CELTA is the gold standard for English teacher certifications
09/05/2022, 15:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For teaching non-natives, at least

Obviously most people speak some English in Hong Kong, but even still, I may get some use out of it
09/05/2022, 15:50 - Damien Fung: yeah i wanted to teach some bel-air rich kids cs this summer but i'm probably just gonna focus on learning stuff myself
09/05/2022, 15:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Honestly working for ESF in like ten years wouldn't be the worst thing ever
09/05/2022, 15:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Cheap housing in Hong Kong
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Damien Fung: cheap?
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or, cheap for Hong Kong
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: ESF subsidises housing, does it not
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Damien Fung: oh huh
09/05/2022, 15:52 - Damien Fung: pull a chunks
09/05/2022, 15:53 - Damien Fung: get rich and once you get enough to retire just teach for fun
09/05/2022, 15:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 15:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: is that what he's doing?
09/05/2022, 15:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'll have to ask him on Thursday actually
09/05/2022, 15:54 - Damien Fung: i mean he was a VP of a bank i thought that's what he did
09/05/2022, 15:54 - Damien Fung: oooo are y'all meeting up
09/05/2022, 15:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I am going back to the UK then, so I'm gonna meet up with him between trains
09/05/2022, 15:55 - Damien Fung: nice nice
09/05/2022, 15:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And then staying in the UK long enough to do my one in person exam and move my shit into next year's house, before immediately leaving for HK
09/05/2022, 15:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's funny, I haven't spent more than one week in any given country since April. Thank u interrail I guess
09/05/2022, 15:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also lol @ the esf website saying taxis are cheap in hk
09/05/2022, 15:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Cheap for who
09/05/2022, 15:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Then again, maybe my aversion to taxis is sth my parents taught me and irrational on the whole - my mother is the kind of person who measures out exact values of bus fare in coins so as to save like fifty cents on section fare routes
09/05/2022, 16:07 - Cindy Yang: have y'all seen im thinking of ending things
09/05/2022, 16:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No
09/05/2022, 16:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean
09/05/2022, 16:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Nooooo pls doooon't
09/05/2022, 16:10 - Tara: No you're right it's expensive
09/05/2022, 16:10 - Tara: Everything in HK is expensive
09/05/2022, 16:11 - Tara: Also tell Me Chainani we say hi
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: Whaziz
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Patsy Ng: they're relatively cheap

they should be more expensive bc taxi drivers do not currently earn a living wage iirc
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: How much are they in the UK
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: Ok ok actually thinking about transportation in HK properly
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Patsy Ng: idk bc I refuse to take a cab
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Uk taxis are apparently worse but also buses are Much worse
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: So like
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: Not bad
In the UK apparently you have to pay the full fare
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The difference is not as much?
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Patsy Ng: but hk transport is gold itvs one of the things I miss most
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: Which is stupid
09/05/2022, 16:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like taxis in HK are ten times bus prices
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Patsy Ng: the buses here are like 10 times more expensive
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: Yeesh
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But because UK buses are already five times the HK buses
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Cindy Yang: same
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: Wow
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: God I love how efficient HK is
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Cindy Yang: movey
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: Wish other places had that
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Cindy Yang: it do be like that
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Cindy Yang: here too
09/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: Then I can leave this place
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: Sibling keeps telling me off for taking taxis because they're a waste of money
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Actually, no, worse. Two pounds for thirty minutes' walk on flat... UK buses are ridiculous

And then like, seemingly at random they're sometimes free and there are a billion different kinds of tickets or whatever
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Patsy Ng: they are
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And like
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You have to talk to the driver????
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Just give me a bit to tap my card on
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: ....you do?
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And let me do that
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And get on
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And get off at my stop
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah so they can charge you the right amount
09/05/2022, 16:14 - Patsy Ng: they're like that in london but only for london
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Cindy Yang: bruh what
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: I'm gonna die as a tourist there
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: I don't want to talk to people
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think you can use some app
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: Nightmare scenario
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: To select your ticket before you get on
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And then scan your phone
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: I guess I'll just walk everywhere
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or some bullshit
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: Get those steps™️
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In Swansea
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But no
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Damien Fung: and in canada
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Me
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I walk thirty minutes to the grocery store and thirty minutes back, fuck that noise
09/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: Wow
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Patsy Ng: stagecoach

i have it but using it stresses me out plus you're stranded if your phone runs out of battery so i prefer talking to the driver
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Patsy Ng: same
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: Parents are all about Being Efficient and would probably murder me for walking half an hour and back for groceries
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Damien Fung: is uk walkable?
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Damien Fung: or is it like an american city
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: They're like oh cooking food is a waste of time
09/05/2022, 16:16 - Damien Fung: minus london
09/05/2022, 16:17 - Patsy Ng: depends

st andrews is walkable bc the main streets haven't changed since the like. 900s

london is walkable simply bc it's so dense

but swindon (where we spent new year) was completely unwalkable
09/05/2022, 16:17 - Damien Fung: damn
09/05/2022, 16:17 - Damien Fung: man the other day
09/05/2022, 16:17 - Tara: Was everything really far in Swindon
09/05/2022, 16:17 - Damien Fung: i was walking at the neighboring city with friends
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Damien Fung: and we almost got hit by a bus bc we were on the 1.5m wide sidewalk
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yes
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is important bc if you're out late you will have to walk it
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Damien Fung: like it scraped one of their umbrellas
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Tara: Oh yikes
09/05/2022, 16:18 - Damien Fung: oh damn
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Love walking home at 3am!
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Tara: No!!
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Damien Fung: man i love how van is one of the most walkable and public transportable cities in NA
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Tara: Terrifying
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Damien Fung: but then i remember hk
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Absolutely
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Tara: Not Vancouver
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Tara: Vancouver is aight
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Tara: I mean is it safe
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Patsy Ng: it was an 8 min drive to the airbnb

which was equivalent to like. an hour long walk
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Damien Fung: aw man i got food at the sketchy part of town last year and man the junkies there were p scary
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Can't even dress slutty because it's so cold at night and there's never any place to put a coat

Thank god I hate clubbing, I couldn't cope
09/05/2022, 16:19 - Damien Fung: needles left and right
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: Bruh
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I literally only leave home for kpop nights (which they stopped doing because Swansea is smol)
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: Man I wanna walk late at night
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Damien Fung: was a bit better on wednesday bc i got drunk and friends were escorting me home
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean I leave home for groceries and such but not in the middle of the night
09/05/2022, 16:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You're in HK you could probably do it
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Damien Fung: ^
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: I could definitely
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: But I do not have friends nearby to walk with
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Damien Fung: fair fair
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meri I guess?
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Are you still in dorm or
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: Good point
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: No I'm at home
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: Have been since Feb
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Damien Fung: man walking 6km back to campus the other night was really fun. friends and i just talked a bunch and the weather was really nice
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Patsy Ng: where would you walk late at night tho
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Meri has been known to go outside running late I believe
09/05/2022, 16:21 - Patsy Ng: just. out?
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: Not in pokfulam because it's too familiar
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Damien Fung: caught the bus like 5 mins before my free transit pass expired
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: TKO
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Patsy Ng: nice
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: No nvm I hate TKO at night
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Damien Fung: tko?
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: It's awful and scary and empty
09/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: Tseung Kwan O

09/05/2022, 16:23 - Patsy Ng: did not see
09/05/2022, 16:23 - Damien Fung: central is fun to walk at night
09/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: Oh yes good idea
09/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: Latest I've been out was causeway bay at around 12
09/05/2022, 16:23 - Patsy Ng: no it just is

09/05/2022, 16:24 - Tara: Shenme
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Tara: Lucky
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Damien Fung: 3am for me bc i got back from myro's place and didn't realize the 58 didn't run at 3am
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Damien Fung: luckily dad was awake and picked me up
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Tara: O no how did you get back
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Tara: Taxi?
09/05/2022, 16:24 - Tara: Oh ok great
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: Where's that
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Damien Fung: no idea
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Patsy Ng: wait where is this
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Cindy Yang: tuen mun?
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: Ok scrap the idea of walking at night
The thought of it is anxiety inducing
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Patsy Ng: oh
09/05/2022, 16:25 - Damien Fung: probably?
09/05/2022, 16:26 - Cindy Yang: that's what one of the comments says idk if it's right
09/05/2022, 16:26 - Tara: But I can go with friends idk why I'm assuming I'm going alone
09/05/2022, 16:26 - Tara: I don't wanna go with others though
09/05/2022, 16:26 - Damien Fung: yeah scrolled more and the poster confirmed
09/05/2022, 16:27 - Damien Fung: ooo i wanna go to the peak at late night
09/05/2022, 16:27 - Tara: I have my best thoughts while walking haha
If you have a problem and ask me stuff then I'll reply later only because I went for a walk to think about it
09/05/2022, 16:27 - Tara: Oh yeah the peak is good nvm
09/05/2022, 16:28 - Patsy Ng: no it is terrifying

the top is ok but once you get on the trail to go down it is awful, or when you're on the unlit roads like lugard road

granted this is based off memories from year 9 (for some reason every monday when i got home from school i'd just take off into the hills by myself and only come back once it got dark)
09/05/2022, 16:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Did I ever tell you guys about that time
09/05/2022, 16:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk if you knew me then
09/05/2022, 16:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't remember which year it was
09/05/2022, 16:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay so you know when we hiked to the peak and the teachers were like "oh if you walk backwards it's less tiring" or sth?
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Tara: Yes!! I remember this
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And I fell like one or two metres off some ledge because wtf was that advice
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Tara: Omg 😭😭
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Patsy Ng: we hiked to the peak a lot

year 2, year 6, year 7, probably more that i forgot
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I wasn't seriously hurt but like
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Man
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Tara: Oh lawd nvm terrifying
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Tara: I was not gonna hike though
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Tara: Just wanna wallow around
09/05/2022, 16:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Thank god I fell on my back bc if I had fallen on my front that could have been really bad for my arms, knees, palms, nose
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I didn't skin anything or even bleed
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or break any bones
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But like
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Tara: Is the backwards walking thing real
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Patsy Ng: i mean it's slightly better when you take a torch

which i started doing, bc i don't think i had data then so i couldn't google maps my way out if i got lost
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Tara: I can't tell whether someone has their TV on really loud or is drilling or if I'm imagining this
09/05/2022, 16:31 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "sure, a child fell their entire height and landed on their spine but nothing bad *actually* happened so nobody needs to know"
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Patsy Ng: one time some tourists asked me for some directions

then i walked off by myself and climbed a tree and then they passed me again later and were like "yo can we take a photo"
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Tara: Oh god remember Alice
She like fell down two or three stairs and really injured her back that one year
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Tara: Yeesh she broke a lot of stuff
09/05/2022, 16:32 - Patsy Ng: no???
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Is this supposed to be an animated gif or is it small for no reason
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: She was in crutches for a bit!
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: It's small for Jo reason
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: No*
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: Even in Kennedy
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: So many broken bones
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: So many injuries
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The white kids loved breaking bones
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: They really do
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk why
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Cindy Yang: y'all ever broken a bone?
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: She wasn't even a rugby kid
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They should have just drunk milk
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Since they can and all
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: Multiple
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: She was
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: Oh was she
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Patsy Ng: the only fall i remember was harshul in year 9 thailand community service sitting on the railing waiting for his turn on the climbing wall and then he fell backwards and smashed his head on the concrete

nothing too bad but he wasn't allowed to climb after that
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Tara: That explains stuff
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I was friends with Alice in like year 2-3
09/05/2022, 16:33 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: Remember in year 6 when he fell off his bed and his eye was read for ages
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Cindy Yang: read
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: When she was like a tomboy or whatever
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Patsy Ng: do not know
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: Like a really deep red**
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I will still maintain that although she had a two book advantage
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Damien Fung: weaklings /s
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I did beat her to the end of the Harry Potter series
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: Nice
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: That's all that matters
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Patsy Ng: it was year 5 but yeah

i sat next to him and he enjoyed creeping me out with it
09/05/2022, 16:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Although that achievement grows more dubious day by day
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh yeah he did that at BoB
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Show off the red eye
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Cindy Yang: when i was five i stuck my hand in the gap between the door and the side of the elevator
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Tara: No????
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Tara: Ma'am
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And then in year 6 they decided to do an all girl BoB team
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Tara: Yeah!!! Feminism
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Damien Fung: ouch
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Martin Lee-Paterson: go feminism I guess
09/05/2022, 16:35 - Cindy Yang: i was fine but i think after that they put stickers on the doors in south ho saying mind your hands
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Hahaha
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Cindy Yang: not sure if that was cos of me or i'm misremembering
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: I had so many injuries as a child
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Patsy Ng: was that an active decision? i thought that was just who ended up being the best at bob

bc ms sarjana was. way too competitive for a primary school vice principal
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Like accidental ones
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Damien Fung: when i was in kindergarten i apparently accidentally stabbed someone in the eye with a fork at a bday party
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Bro
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If you're white you have no excuse for weak bones
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Jesus
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Cindy Yang: bruh
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If you are Caucasian and break a bone that's on you!!!
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Gonna list some idk
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: honestly probably
09/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Don't mind me
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: None of the boys did any of the reading
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Tara: Someone shot one of those fake arrows into my eye while I was on a swing
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Tara: You know the plastic ones with the suction thing at the end
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If Ms Sarjarna wanted to be competitive so bad she should have simply won the competition
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: We never did
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Damien Fung: dude the amount of milk I've had throughout my 20 years is absurd
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Tara: RIP
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Tara: I love mill
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: you can still drink milk?
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Tara: Milk*
09/05/2022, 16:37 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I lost that ability after puberty
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: Do you have lactose intolerance
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: Because most people just suck it up /s
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can still like
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Damien Fung: idk why but i always buy 4l jugs and they always have like 1l remaining the week before they expire so i start chugging it with coffee
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Suffer through cheese
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But I can't do milk
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If I have liquid milk I wake up at 2am and throw up
09/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: How bout ice-cream
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Uh, in reasonable quantities
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which defeats the point of ice cream
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: can't buy 2l bc it ain't enough
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Who the fuck has like, a healthy amount of ice cream
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Cindy Yang: rip
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Tara: Can you not buy 3
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Tara: It's more of an all or nothing sorta deal
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Damien Fung: unoptimized fridge space
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I buy the little 200ml jugs for pancakes and that's it
09/05/2022, 16:39 - Patsy Ng: it's so weird to think about ks bob now bc like. wis bob was completely different

like ms sarjana was Out For The Kill

basically only the six best people would compete and everyone else was backup unless your parents happened to be watching, in which case you'd go on Once

and whenever we lost she'd be like. obviously disappointed

meanwhile ms leone sorted out a roster so everyone on the team would go on for an equal number of rounds, and she was all like fraternization with the other schools! just go out and have fun! talk to everyone else!

which is wack bc you'd expect the secondary school league to be more competitive
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: I think we buy a carton of 12 every 2/3 weeks
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Cindy Yang: wow
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: Which approach did you like better
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: Imagine fraternising with the enemt
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: Enemy
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Cindy Yang: never had any adverse reaction to milk so still not sure if i'm lactose intolerant
09/05/2022, 16:40 - Patsy Ng: can you get a 2L and a 1L 

or simply buy 2L more frequently
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think inter school friendships are kind of doomed for me?
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Tara: I have a not great reaction to soft cheese
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Cindy Yang: combine them for a 21L
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay unless you have mutual friends with somebody
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Tara: JavaScript be like
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This is my hot take
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's a lot of work being friends
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If you have mutual friends it's easy
09/05/2022, 16:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because you can have unstructured group convos and a group chat
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But with a solo friend you have to actively go talk to them
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Damien Fung: dilemma: 2l+1l takes up more fridge area than 4l. buying more 2l means more grocery store trips

solution: buy 4l and just chug it right before it expires (benefit of saving a few bucks)
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Cringe
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Oh god the number of groupchats I'm in now
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Ridiculous
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Thank God we only have like two
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Cindy Yang: lmao
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Tara: I only have two with y'all
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Idk how many you guys have
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: School is basically a friend fusion reactor because it forces you to have like
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Cindy Yang: it do be like that
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Patsy Ng: ms leone's

it was just more enjoyable

also we were encouraged to skip lunch (like. we had 5-10 mins max to eat?) by ms sarjana to train bc bob sessions were at lunch

and toms sessions were also at lunch so yeah did not end up eating loads in year 6

which probably didn't do wonders for my eating schedule in year 7 until ellie snapped me out of it by saying "just because you can [skip lunch] doesn't mean you should"
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Cindy Yang: man i feel like i did nothing this school year
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Cindy Yang: so unproductive
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Interactions with people
09/05/2022, 16:42 - Damien Fung: mood
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which means it's less work to have friends than to not!
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Patsy Ng: wait what's the second

the maths help one?
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: I need to leave some omg idk what partay planning one is
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: Yah pretty much
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Patsy Ng: you started tutoring people

you got covid (an experience)

you got a boyfriend
09/05/2022, 16:43 - Damien Fung: this term i had to give up my hunt for the best hot wings in van bc my maths assignments were due on the one day my wings finding partner was free for wings
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think that's why I'm so good at twitter, like, you can just have ppl on your feed and you can reply to them, there's no need to keep track of all the humans in your life. If you feel like talking to sb you already have a topic (their post) and a public space
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Damien Fung: isn't that dead
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Tara: Yes
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Cindy Yang: i suppose
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Cindy Yang: everyone's done more tho
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Tara: I use it for Important Conversations Pertaining to Mathematics
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Damien Fung: hmmm I've only really got like 3/4 active chats around
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Cindy Yang: feel like i should have made more friends
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I did a lot this school year
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Damien Fung: mood but I'm happy with my small circle
09/05/2022, 16:44 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: closer friends are more meaningful
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: If they're quality then who cares
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: This year was a rollercoaster Jesus
Made friends lost friends smh
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Cindy Yang: :( but my closest friends i made are seniors from my german class that already graduated
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: like what's the point of friends if you can't continuously get tacos every 2nd day with them
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: On one hand I wish I had more in person friends but on the other I like having ppl spread out
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: :(((
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And I like keeping to myself in downtime
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: Covid
09/05/2022, 16:45 - Damien Fung: on a side note i need to eat more tacos on tuesday
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: I don't have it there was a lockdown obvs
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: Next sem I'm gonna make more friends
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: I have a couple of people in my mind
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: I will befriend them
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: Interview them for a spot in the chat
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also I'm just not super interested in my peers, I'm sure we *could* be friends but nobody ever talks to anybody
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: Because that's completely normal
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Cindy Yang: funky
09/05/2022, 16:46 - Cindy Yang: how do u graduate from being acquaintances to friends
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm much more interested in getting to know my lecturers in a not sus way
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: same for me here
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: tacos
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Cindy Yang: like would it be weird to ask someone you've casually talked to to hang out
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I actually know things about them and they have things to teach me
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: "hey wanna grab tacos some time?"
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 😏
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:47 - Damien Fung: i usually bring a few people along and then people mingle then you get friends
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Patsy Ng: is anyone else. surprised by the amount of friends they've made over the past year

like for complicated reasons i was very convinced i'd just. keep my head down for the entire year and be an academic robot 

but then somehow i ended up with A Lot of people to care about and it's a bit weird
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: Force them to hang out with you
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Cindy Yang: aww i'm glad
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Damien Fung: "hey i want your _tacos_ tonight"
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: No absolutely not that's how you make friends
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Damien Fung: eyyy nice nice
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I could probably disappear right now and nobody would check in on me except like, my Korean tutor
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Patsy Ng: deep talks in the canteen tbh
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean like, I did
09/05/2022, 16:48 - Cindy Yang: idk i always feel like ppl are just putting up with me and will be weirded out if i ask them to hang
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Damien Fung: idk I've got like 5 people here i call close friends
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: No that is your insecurity talking
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ah I don't go to a canteen and nobody sits with strangers there
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: Get out there and make friends
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: You are a cool nice person
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Cindy Yang: thank u
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: And you will make quality friend s
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Damien Fung: yeah same except I don't have a canteen
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Damien Fung: it's just public space
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Cindy Yang: forever battling against the feeling of being a weirdo loser 😔
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Societies are good
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's like having semi friends
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Damien Fung: we live
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Patsy Ng: wait @447380604852 what about your kpop buddies
09/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: God I'm so annoyed there was a thing earlier this year which ruined everything and fjakcjaj
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Cindy Yang: oof how come
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Patsy Ng: what was it
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Cindy Yang: 'wanna hang at the public space?'
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Tara: Don't let your friends date each other it's awful and terrible
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The kpop society is neat because I can go and I'm treated as a member and as a fun person people like, but I don't particularly need to commit to much
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Damien Fung: just waltz up to someone enjoying their lunch and say "hey do you have games on your phone"
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Cindy Yang: o dear
09/05/2022, 16:50 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Patsy Ng: wait is this about how efje was gonna ask someone out on valentines day
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: Oh no before that
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: But 
But
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Damien Fung: aw man I'm trying to hook my close friend up with another friend of mine and idk if it's working but I'll see
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also networking with people who are not local is fun bc they have more interesting lives
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: It turns out those two friends disliked each other and I was left to pick up the pieces
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: Legit dummies
09/05/2022, 16:51 - Damien Fung: close friend owes me like 5 cookies now
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Swansea is not bad but it's so blah
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Tara: Yes do that who knows maybe it'll work out
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, there's a total of like
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: 500m of high street
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Patsy Ng: wait they started dating each other while they disliked each other???
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And the rest is literally just houses
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Tara: Oh no sorry I'm messing it up
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Damien Fung: unfortunately the friend is doing the MCATs this summer so he's busy af
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't know where the people in those houses must work
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or where they are
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Cindy Yang: dangg
09/05/2022, 16:52 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because I sure as hell never see them
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Damien Fung: both are very innocent christian people so it's a very hint hint kinda wingman for me
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I have literally never let a triangle with 5km sides
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Patsy Ng: uni staff? not just lecturers, cleaning staff and porters and groundskeepers and things
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because there is nothing outside it
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Patsy Ng: this sentence is mildly incomprehensible
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Cindy Yang: i see
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Damien Fung: love triangle?
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Tara: So two friends (friends 1 and 2) disliked each other since fall sem but stayed ""friends"" because they were friends with me
Then in December friend 1 got together with friend 3
Broke up in Jan
Their breakup also led to friend 1 breaking up with friend 2 permanently
09/05/2022, 16:53 - Martin Lee-Paterson: yeah I guess, and students
09/05/2022, 16:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Weird thing is that Swansea is a net positive commute city which means more people come here to work than go elsewhere
09/05/2022, 16:54 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 16:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which means that not only do all the people in the sea of houses have jobs
09/05/2022, 16:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There are also people who *don't* live there with jobs there
09/05/2022, 16:54 - Cindy Yang: shortlived relationship
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Cindy Yang: wack
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Tara: Then in Feb friend 1 was being annoying at how I ""left them on read"" when they had read receipts off and I was like nope
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Tara: I was trying to help them in Feb but well
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Damien Fung: oh yeah that's ubc's problem. everyone is a commuter since we're on the edge of the city so if you wanna hang out after class they'll probably be gone by then
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Martin Lee-Paterson: There are too many people in the world (not in a fascistic thanosy way but in a "enotionally, I don't understand how all these people can have rich inner lives"
09/05/2022, 16:55 - Cindy Yang: it do be like that
09/05/2022, 16:56 - Patsy Ng: bruh who cares about being left on read for a bit
09/05/2022, 16:56 - Tara: Idk tell them
09/05/2022, 16:56 - Tara: The immaturity ✨✨
09/05/2022, 16:56 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, it sounds horrible but I kind of have to assume the majority of people aren't interesting and are just living?
09/05/2022, 16:56 - Damien Fung: i think this is what's happening
09/05/2022, 16:57 - Patsy Ng: what's the roadblock

they just. do? like you don't have to get it but they just. have lives you know nothing about
09/05/2022, 16:57 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, my older brother. I have no ill feeling towards him but he acts as if he is not a person
09/05/2022, 16:57 - Damien Fung: all my friends here either have jobs or summer courses rn so I'm just chilling with the wisacino people on discord but they're also starting exams so it's just me, myro, and eric

09/05/2022, 16:57 - Damien Fung: guess I'm the boring one rn

09/05/2022, 16:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He also thinks he is a business owner because he works as a Deliveroo driver
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Damien Fung: we made a new one for EU people but the rest migrated there so yeah redundancy
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Cindy Yang: o sorry i meant the one where they got together
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He thinks zero hour contracts are entrepreneurship because he 'chooses his clients'
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Damien Fung: the old one stays around for history purposes
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Tara: Oh right yes
09/05/2022, 16:58 - Tara: Very short
Should not have been a big deal
09/05/2022, 16:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which means that whenever I say something corporate seems silly he can go "well, you don't understand it because you're not a businessman like me"

I studied business for exactly as long as he did!
09/05/2022, 16:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: We both have exactly the same business iGCSE!
09/05/2022, 17:00 - Tara: Lmao
09/05/2022, 17:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also he wears his Deliveroo jacket as if it's fashion?

09/05/2022, 17:01 - Patsy Ng: not for hk
09/05/2022, 17:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, I don't understand how you can convince yourself that a job so shit they're trying to change laws all over the world to make it even worse makes you Mark Zuckerberg

And then never aspire to more
09/05/2022, 17:02 - Tara: Definitely not
09/05/2022, 17:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He says he's going to move to Liverpool in a few years. Everybody knows he's never going to move to Liverpool

09/05/2022, 17:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't even like sex all that much so kissing is a W
09/05/2022, 17:12 - Cindy Yang: ok this is nice but also this is just. wet flesh against wet flesh
09/05/2022, 17:12 - Damien Fung: lmaooooooo

09/05/2022, 17:14 - Martin Lee-Paterson: TMI but I'm pretty sure I don't experience the physical sensations of s word the way other people do, so it's all just wet flesh. At least kissing is easy enough
09/05/2022, 17:14 - Cindy Yang: it's cos everyone's on
09/05/2022, 17:14 - Damien Fung: yeee
09/05/2022, 17:14 - Tara: bro im so annoyed i havent figured out whether im ace or bi but absolutely terrified of relationships

09/05/2022, 17:15 - Damien Fung: relationships do be scary
09/05/2022, 17:15 - Cindy Yang: like we'll be walking and he'll be like squishing it
09/05/2022, 17:15 - Tara: upper arm or lower arm
09/05/2022, 17:15 - Patsy Ng: i did send this to mom tho

she was trying to guess what the stuff i wasn't telling her was

and she was like "if you like girls you can tell me! i won't be mad :)" and i was internally laughing my ass off bc the person is nonbinary

which is. incidentally probably why i didn't have crushes in wis
09/05/2022, 17:15 - Cindy Yang: upper
09/05/2022, 17:15 - Patsy Ng: bc there wasn't anyone for me to crush on
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: i see
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Tara: awww
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: so i have given him ownership of my arm
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: only the left tho
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Patsy Ng: is that like. good or bad
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Tara: ???
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Careful, that's how the fey get you
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: if he starts squishing my right i make him move to the other side
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: good i guess
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Tara: hahahah
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Cindy Yang: it's amusing
09/05/2022, 17:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: When the time comes for you to pass on to the afterlife you will be armless
09/05/2022, 17:17 - Cindy Yang: o yea reason i asked about how to say mother in law in chinese is cos that's what his mom asked
09/05/2022, 17:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Bit presumptuous
09/05/2022, 17:17 - Cindy Yang: and i only realized after what the implication is
09/05/2022, 17:17 - Damien Fung: nice nice
09/05/2022, 17:17 - Tara: wow jumping ahead of ourselves lmao

09/05/2022, 17:18 - Tara: rip

09/05/2022, 17:18 - Tara: it's just not done
09/05/2022, 17:18 - Damien Fung: i realize i always bump into people when walking in a line
09/05/2022, 17:18 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:18 - Tara: sir
09/05/2022, 17:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think my older brother will probably marry his gf because he doesn't appear to be interested in changing any aspect of his life
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Damien Fung: I don't know why
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Cindy Yang: who's his gf

09/05/2022, 17:19 - Damien Fung: nice nice
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But like, even if she were not I think he would
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Tara: we stan
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Cindy Yang: nice
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Patsy Ng: i'm exaggerating but it's just. a love square

the characters were interesting but also flawed and i think i just got a bit bored of their flaws and high school drama

maybe i've grown out of the ya genre 

which is a shame bc i liked a couple of the author
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Patsy Ng: s other books while still in wis
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Tara: how do you have a square
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Right now I'm really interested in
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Cindy Yang: o yea the bf has told me about mexican candy
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Cindy Yang: some interesting stuff
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Gay ppl during historical events?
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Not romance necessarily
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Tara: person 1 likes person 2
person 2 likes person 3
person 3 likes person 4
person 4 likes person 1
09/05/2022, 17:19 - Tara: nice
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't care particularly much for big romances between two people
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: what's it like
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But just gay people having communities and coming in and out of each other's lives as they age and grow
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: have you guys read a little life
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: do not recommend
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: too sad
09/05/2022, 17:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, I read this book Christopher And His Kind recently and it's a memoir by Christopher Isherwood about his life around the time before ww2 started
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: He lived in Berlin for a time and all
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Tara: if no one's gonna read it
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Tara: i want to rant a bit about it
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And he has various boyfriends and sex partners and the like but it's not all consuming? He's very careful not to let the book be About anything
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Cindy Yang: forgot the name but there's like, lollipop with different flavored layers
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Tara: which includes spoilers
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Patsy Ng: A, B, and C are a squad

A and B start dating

unbeknownst to A and B, C has a crush on A

A and B break up

B starts dating D

A has lots of rebound sex with C

D dies

A and D have grief sex after bonding after D's funeral

A starts dating C, they remain friends with D
09/05/2022, 17:21 - Damien Fung: oh there's this french cartoon isabel watches and the square there is funky. the 2 protagonists have superhero identities.

normal identity likes superhero identity who likes superhero identity who likes normal identity
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's really interesting because he moves from place to place as the politics and the war and stuff move him and for a time a boyfriend from place to place
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: miraculous ladybug?
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Damien Fung: ye
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: nice
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: was popular on tumblr
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Damien Fung: she really likes the show
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Tara: who has grief sex?
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And he has friends who he's close with at some points, grows apart from, and grows close to again
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: ppl who are sad and horny i suppose
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Damien Fung: every female lead in You
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's like if you had a pond and all these famous authors from the thirties are little model boats
09/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: funky
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And somebody dropped a big rock in the pond
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Cindy Yang: have heard of it
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And you're watching the ripples push the boats around, rock them, bounce off the edges of the pond
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Damien Fung: don't orgasms release dopamine kr smth
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Cindy Yang: probably
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The additive and destructive interference as the force ricochets
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Patsy Ng: OHHHH yeah the thing that really annoyed me was its constant pop culture references

and it was written in 2016ish so the pop culture references are all harry potter and star wars

i can deal with the star wars cause it's only for a bit but the main character is obsessed with harry potter and it's just. kind of exhausting when one of the main character's main external personality traits is obsession with a dated book series
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And moves communities and indiciduals
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Patsy Ng: yes i loved it
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Cindy Yang: ouch
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Patsy Ng: i read it twice i think
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This is why you read old shit!
09/05/2022, 17:23 - Cindy Yang: wow physic
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: which is why the book is called Christopher And His Kind I think
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Cindy Yang: little lives
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Patsy Ng: is this the miraculous ladybug
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Cindy Yang: the one and only
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Damien Fung: ye
09/05/2022, 17:24 - Damien Fung: fuck am i the only one who didn't know about it
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Damien Fung: now i really feel uncultured
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's about him I guess, but also it's about the people he counts himself among. Writer's like E.M Forster, Virginia Woolf and her husband, gay ppl, expats, people displaced by Hitler, people who speak German
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Damien Fung: i thought it was just a canadian thingy
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Damien Fung: and french ofc
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And this is why I am really annoyed about the movie
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They made a movie of this book some years back with Matt Smith
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: ok there's this one dude called jude
as a child he was abused at a monastery
one brother runs away with him and forces him into prostitution
escapes and is abused at the orphanage
runs away and gets picked up by a doctor who physically and sexually abuses him then runs him over
as an adult he gets into a relationship with an abusive fellow who rapes and leaves him to death
then his long term partner and friends and die in a car accident
then he takes his own life
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And it's super super focused on a specific bit of the book
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: also he has a crippled leg
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: so chronic pain from that
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: also cuts himself with razers
09/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: it's like
she's writing trauma for the sake of it
09/05/2022, 17:26 - Tara: there are a few happy moments
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Tara: but he's so depressed he feels like he doesn't deserve any of it
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Tara: yet refuses to seek help
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Patsy Ng: i did! the book i'd read before that was a room with a view, which is just. so horrendously edwardian that i wanted something relatively modern

the book before that tho was patron saints of nothing, which was supremely good, it's about a second-gen filipino-american reconnecting with the philippines while also trying to figure out what happened to his dead cousin, while also exploring diff attitudes to the war on drugs
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Tara: until the end
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: big oof
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Okay so it is hyper focused specifically on the bit set in Germany
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But not any of Christopher's writer friends really
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: deutschland babey
09/05/2022, 17:27 - Patsy Ng: i read an interview of the author and she said she wanted to write a book where the main character doesn't get better, because sometimes life doesn't work out that way and some people don't get better
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Only on a few people that pop up in his more famous books
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And also
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Cindy Yang: mildly entertaining the thought of living in germany
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It focuses super fucking hard on the nazis' rise to power?
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Tara: ok that's fair but jesus it was way too much
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Do it I will go with
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Cindy Yang: :(((((
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Three of us, Dusseldorf
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Win
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Cindy Yang: yeet
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is finr
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's an important part of the book
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's also background noise in the book in a sense?
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Cindy Yang: if only because seems cool and also am continuing with german past my language requirement
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Damien Fung: ooo that sounds funky
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's the ripple but we're watching the boats
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Tara: noo it's not
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Tara: it's awful
09/05/2022, 17:28 - Tara: and terrible
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Cindy Yang: apparently we're studying fairy tales and poetry next sem
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Patsy Ng: really?
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Tara: and very depressing
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Damien Fung: 👀
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Tara: i remember rage quitting the book on the mtr
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Damien Fung: idk I've been really interested in stories that don't end on a good note
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Cindy Yang: o yea lmao the bf tried to say like oh i can hear your heart but he accidentally said lungs instead
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which is to say, if you don't care to adapt the people Christopher meets who live in Germany, like how he rented a room for some time and grew close to Magnus Hirschfeld who was the world's foremost academic on matters of homosexuality and trans issues
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Cindy Yang: u seen devilman crybaby?
09/05/2022, 17:29 - Damien Fung: think I've been watching too much breaking bad
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: How can you possibly hope to get the emotional payoff when you do adapt a book burning that happened when people stormed the institute and destroyed its library?
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Tara: do you want a book that was also a bit devastating but she survives in the end and gets help
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Damien Fung: char -> darth vader
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Tara: eleanor oliphant is completely fine
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Patsy Ng: this one is a really not good note one tho

i think. you have to be in a certain mental state to enjoy it

like you need to have suffered to understand the book, but you also need to be extremely mentally healthy atm so reading it doesn't plunge you back into a depressive state or sth
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It misses the people for the noise, it wants to be a generic ww2 movie so bad that it cuts like 80% of the book and skims the remaining 20 per cent
09/05/2022, 17:30 - Tara: no that's too uplifting actually
09/05/2022, 17:31 - Tara: agreed
09/05/2022, 17:31 - Cindy Yang: owch
09/05/2022, 17:31 - Damien Fung: man after getting completely career shifted by major placements last year i just started doing whatever might work out better
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Idk I will rant about this in person sometime
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Tara: but like i was realy really mad at the author and i did not enjoy it
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Cindy Yang: sure
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Tara: looking back
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Damien Fung: i have resorted to chance at this point
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Patsy Ng: wait how is this connected
09/05/2022, 17:32 - Tara: it might have been the mental state thing
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Tara: ooh
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Tara: i have a book
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Cindy Yang: buque?
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Cindy Yang: buch?
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Tara: that doesnt end on a particularly good note
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Tara: the secret history
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Cindy Yang: what's it about
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Martin Lee-Paterson: @447759215825 read Christopher And His Kind, there is a lot of gay sex but it is not graphic and I think other than that you will probably enjoy  it for the way it gives you an inside look at various historical figures in the field of writing
09/05/2022, 17:33 - Tara: uni students and death
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Patsy Ng: yeah i think i'd enjoy it
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: funky
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: a classics class
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If nothing else, just reading other books discussed within would give you material enough for some months after you were done
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: at uni
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Damien Fung: i think my mental state would be fine to enjoy it? idk things turning out really bad seem to be normal ish to me nowadays
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: and also anything to do with the trojan war
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: for example
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: song of achilles
09/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: 1000 ships
09/05/2022, 17:35 - Patsy Ng: yeet go for it then
09/05/2022, 17:35 - Damien Fung: maybe it's also me turning a bit too doomer with the economy in vancouver approaching hk levels
09/05/2022, 17:35 - Tara: hang in there friend
09/05/2022, 17:35 - Damien Fung: ah man i love vancouver. heaven on earth but only if you have the money
09/05/2022, 17:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oof
09/05/2022, 17:36 - Martin Lee-Paterson: hongcouver indeed
09/05/2022, 17:36 - Damien Fung: nah hk's p shite. pollution and all
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Patsy Ng: is it weird that i kind of miss the dirt in hk
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Patsy Ng: not dirt dirt but earth
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Tara: yeah that's weird
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Damien Fung: like the soil?
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Tara: we dont have much of it
09/05/2022, 17:37 - Damien Fung: i miss the concrete jungle
09/05/2022, 17:38 - Cindy Yang: :(((((
09/05/2022, 17:38 - Cindy Yang: u doin ok bud
09/05/2022, 17:38 - Tara: yes are you ok
09/05/2022, 17:39 - Damien Fung: aaaaaa now i remember once again that gas prices are rising and i should've asked for a bit more and gotten a cheap tesla
09/05/2022, 17:39 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 17:39 - Patsy Ng: like hk earth is red and the dirt here is greyish brown

did a bit of research on soil types and apparently red dirt means it drains quickly, and greyish dirt means it gets waterlogged a lot

and like. i think the uk dirt is more fertile (which is why loads of farming goes on)

but the hk dirt is. rawer and coarser and it feels a little bit truer
09/05/2022, 17:39 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:39 - Patsy Ng: oo you've got a little bit of ocean
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Damien Fung: yeah just looking at wayyyyyy too many vancouver salaries and doing the maths to see how much it costs to buy a home for myself eventually
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Cindy Yang: when i got back to hk it was so weird felt like i had no sense of how long i’d been gone
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Damien Fung: i should really get off linkedin and indeed
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Cindy Yang: *pat pat*
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Cindy Yang: ja ein bisschen des ozean
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: medication has really helped me because previously I would just give up most trips before I even started bc too difficult, but I've chained like five stops so far
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Damien Fung: huh
09/05/2022, 17:40 - Damien Fung: fancy
09/05/2022, 17:41 - Cindy Yang: simply do what i do and do not think about it
09/05/2022, 17:41 - Cindy Yang: nice
09/05/2022, 17:41 - Damien Fung: true but i have 2 years to choose between grinding grades for grad school or grinding leetcode for a job at meta
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Tara: yeah bro linkedin is depressing
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Tara: everyone is so much more experienced
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Damien Fung: like I'm overall happy but just anxious ig
09/05/2022, 17:42 - Damien Fung: with the rate I'm going rn i think I'll be fine
09/05/2022, 17:43 - Cindy Yang: hope so

09/05/2022, 17:43 - Damien Fung: also my sample size for qualifications is very small

09/05/2022, 17:50 - Damien Fung: i go drinking like once every blue moon so when i got relatively drunk the other day and texted her i said flirted with her and some of the words i used triggered her insecurities by accident then she got really pissed the next day bc her mom kinda pushed her a bit too far which trickled over to me
09/05/2022, 17:50 - Damien Fung: also period
09/05/2022, 17:51 - Cindy Yang: big oof
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Patsy Ng: wait i just completely forgot about easter

@weirdest apt gang remember wheni said i was planning an easter egg scavenger hunt

it was for them, bc they'd mentioned doing egg hunts with their sister every year (but obvs their sister wasn't here this year to do egg hunts with)

it went p well, i hid eggs around the dorm and they + some of our other friends + someone another friend invited along + that person's sister searched for the eggs

they got every clue + egg references as well

the final egg was a gigantic terry's chocolate orange egg bc they'd gotten me a chocolate orange for christmas bc i said i'd never had one
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Patsy Ng: oof
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Cindy Yang: aww nice
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Damien Fung: i have also discovered that getting drunk makes me love everyone around me and simp for isabel a bunch
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Tara: that's nice
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Cindy Yang: aww
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Tara: how was the chocolate orange
09/05/2022, 17:52 - Patsy Ng: it's good that you're a nice drunk?
09/05/2022, 17:53 - Cindy Yang: simp drunk
09/05/2022, 17:53 - Damien Fung: awww
09/05/2022, 17:53 - Cindy Yang: hmm the bf has never gotten drunk before
09/05/2022, 17:53 - Tara: @447759215825 do you wanna ask them out
09/05/2022, 17:53 - Tara: have you
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Damien Fung: yeah on christmas i saw warcus sitting on the server and just said i loved him for like 30 mins
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Patsy Ng: great

you know how like. sometimes food tastes better when you have nice memories associated with it? like i don't think i'd have liked it that much if i got it on my own but now i think chocolate oranges might be my favourite chocolates
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Tara: i have yet to get drunk
like a lot of stuff it seems terrifying ✨
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Cindy Yang: awww
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Damien Fung: ^
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Tara: cute
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Damien Fung: i stg i said i loved y'all too
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Tara: probably
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Cindy Yang: think so
09/05/2022, 17:54 - Damien Fung: eyyyy
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Damien Fung: maybe that's why I'm addicted to these cookies
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Damien Fung: gotta get y'all some if y'all visit
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Cindy Yang: sure
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Cindy Yang: what cookies
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Tara: what memories do you associate with those cookies
09/05/2022, 17:55 - Patsy Ng: kind of??? but like. i don't think they're interested in regular relationships and neither am i (i'm more like. holding hands maybe and like. getting to. compliment them. a lot.) and idk how to communicate all that succinctly yet clearly without being a Mess
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Damien Fung: student union cafe has a specialty chocolate cookie with white chocolate inside
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Cindy Yang: hmm i see
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Tara: do you want our assistance
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Damien Fung: well you'll never know if you don't try? just shoot your shot my friend
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Cindy Yang: damn well hope your relationship continues going well regardless
09/05/2022, 17:56 - Tara: im a good wingwoman
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Damien Fung: i have successfully hooked up 4 friends. the only one y'all know are alex and nikki
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Cindy Yang: o damn u hooked them up?
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: i have mildly successfully set up two sets of people
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: first one was the really short relationship though
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: so maybe 1 instead
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Damien Fung: alex asked me "hmmm amanda or nikki" and i was like "smth smth you like nikki more so"
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Patsy Ng: i'm also thinking about timing bc. when would be a good time to ask people out

like. it's about to be summer and then we won't see each other until september but then september is the start of a new school year which means Stress and then coursework is awful and then exams are awful and then it's christmas which means not being geographically close and then new semester start and coursework and exams and summer and repeat
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: ??? why was he asking between two
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: it do be like thay
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Tara: how bout midterm
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: hmm
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Tara: like october
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: honestly just whenever
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: i feel like ur gonna be dealing with all that regardless
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Patsy Ng: i feel like. if you need help with deciding who you like more, you don't actually like either of your choices
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Damien Fung: damn pat you're really analyzing like year 12 me
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Tara: yeah
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Patsy Ng: we don't have midterms
09/05/2022, 17:58 - Cindy Yang: might as well just zoopdidoop and go for it
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Tara: agreed
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Tara: rip that bandaid off
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: forgot tbh
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Patsy Ng: 🙃
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Tara: live your life
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Tara: be happy
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: alternatively
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: do what me and isabel did
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: just complement the hell out of them
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Cindy Yang: having a relationship in school do be a bit hard tho cos it’s like. shit i gotta study but i’ll be so sad if i don’t get to see them
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: then like slowly bring in some flirty stuff
09/05/2022, 17:59 - Damien Fung: until you're used to that
09/05/2022, 18:00 - Tara: come on you just have to prioritise
09/05/2022, 18:00 - Damien Fung: then awkwardly confess
09/05/2022, 18:00 - Tara: you get to see your friends frequently right
09/05/2022, 18:00 - Tara: same with your partner
09/05/2022, 18:00 - Damien Fung: "are you copper tellurium bc you're a CuTe"
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Cindy Yang: lmao
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Patsy Ng: other thing is i'm p sure they're neurodivergent (has like. nmonverbal days and meltdowns) so i don't. wanna push? or do sth that communicates the wrong thing
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Damien Fung: "are you a minecraft fence bc i can't get over you"
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Tara: preparation my dude
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Cindy Yang: bruh
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Damien Fung: "are you a minecraft bonemeal bc you make my sapling grow"
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Tara: just write your feelings in the notes app haha
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Tara: then rewrite it
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Tara: til it's perfect
09/05/2022, 18:01 - Damien Fung: ahhh
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Patsy Ng: no seeing them isn't the issue

it's. you know how when you get asked out and you have to say yes or no and you end up stressing for months after the thing and it just takes up loads of brainspace and thinking time but not any actual doing things time
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Damien Fung: wait what else did i use on isabel
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Patsy Ng: from what you said it was mainly isabel
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Tara: as someone who has never experienced this
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Patsy Ng: and you were clueless
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Cindy Yang: hmmm
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Damien Fung: yeah i was
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Tara: how do you let it take over your thoughts
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Tara: like im genuinely asking
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Damien Fung: but i also returned pickup lines bc i thought it was banter
09/05/2022, 18:02 - Tara: how you do this
09/05/2022, 18:03 - Tara: ive learned the mildly inconvenient way that complimenting someone can be mistaken for flirting
09/05/2022, 18:03 - Patsy Ng: it just. happens? not letting it take over your thoughts is usually the goal
09/05/2022, 18:03 - Damien Fung: it just happens ig?
09/05/2022, 18:04 - Cindy Yang: oof
09/05/2022, 18:04 - Cindy Yang: yea i guess it just does that
09/05/2022, 18:04 - Damien Fung: also don't think i mentioned but i did like someone else at the time so i kinda shrugged it off bc i was spending quite a bit of time with the other person
09/05/2022, 18:04 - Cindy Yang: haven’t experienced that in a crush way tho
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Cindy Yang: dam
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Patsy Ng: wait so why'd you say yes to isabel if you liked someone else
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like you know or you don't
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Tara: Ok you know what yeah that's happened like once for an hour or so when I went back to work
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Tara: Oh nay
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Damien Fung: bc i started to like her after we started talking more and more with each other
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Cindy Yang: nice
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Patsy Ng: ohhhhh
09/05/2022, 18:05 - Damien Fung: so i grew less attached with the other person
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Tara: @447759215825 if your person says yes can we meet them
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Tara: If they're comfortable
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: oh kay so you meant. you liked someone else when you _started_ talking but not by the time she asked you out
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Actually I think I crush less on people I'm close friends with
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Tara: I want to meet all y'all friends because y'all have met mine
09/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: i can ask?
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Tara: Good
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or like, there's two routes with me, either we're friends or we're friends + the potential for lewdness, and once you're sorted in my head the distinction is clear cut
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Patsy Ng: meri's texting buddies with one of my med friends bc med friend wanted to learn about med student experiences in other countries and bond over doctorly things so she's met one of my friends already
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Damien Fung: yeah 

i think i was hanging out with the girl like every few days or smth in november
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You all are non-lewd
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Cindy Yang: :0 damn
09/05/2022, 18:07 - Tara: Waow

09/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: so neither of those avenues leads to romantic relationships?

09/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: "are you a carbon sample bc i wanna date you"
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Tara: If siyoon ever comes back to HK smh
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Cindy Yang: hmm in my experience romantic relationships are not that different from just being really good friends
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Cindy Yang: funky
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Cindy Yang: it slaps
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: "are you an angle bc you're acute"
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Tara: She left in December for Korea ""for the winter break"" and has not come back
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Cindy Yang: oof

09/05/2022, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: aight
09/05/2022, 18:18 - Damien Fung: "Are you the square root of -100? Because you’re a solid 10 but too good to be real"
09/05/2022, 18:18 - Cindy Yang: oop alright
09/05/2022, 18:18 - Cindy Yang: are these all lines y’all used
09/05/2022, 18:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oooof
09/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "Are you the square root of -1? Because you are I." - guy who has never talked to a woman in his life to his hand
09/05/2022, 18:19 - Damien Fung: the most recent one i just found
09/05/2022, 18:19 - Patsy Ng: ok these are hilarious but they feel really. crude? for asking people out

like it feels like asking people out should be. a delicate thing

like the words are made of glass and they're shiny and sparkly and beautiful but you have to like. HANDLE WITH CARE stamp them
09/05/2022, 18:19 - Damien Fung: lmaooooooo
09/05/2022, 18:20 - Damien Fung: so the correct mentality to not losing sleep over this is to approach it guns blazing
09/05/2022, 18:20 - Damien Fung: just do it when y'all are laughing a bunch so if it goes bad it doesn't go bad
09/05/2022, 18:20 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh they're absolutely crude but I also odn't believe asking people out should be a delicate thing
09/05/2022, 18:21 - Cindy Yang: i spose it depends
09/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think once you establish mutual liking it's best to keep things simple
09/05/2022, 18:22 - Patsy Ng: anyway i did like. give them a thing for valentines

a really small thing (origami heart with a penguin drawn on it bc one of the music things we discussed is this animal-themed album and one of the songs is called "your personal penguin" and it's like. a penguin talking to an unidentified addressee and requesting to be their companion forevermore)
09/05/2022, 18:22 - Cindy Yang: aww
09/05/2022, 18:22 - Cindy Yang: that’s cute

09/05/2022, 18:23 - Patsy Ng: your tinder thing was like "awkward sth sth" and he was like "do you want to be awkward together"
09/05/2022, 18:23 - Damien Fung: I don't need sleep i need fun
09/05/2022, 18:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: i don't remember if you did

09/05/2022, 18:26 - Damien Fung: why
09/05/2022, 18:26 - Damien Fung: what is becoming of my mind
09/05/2022, 18:26 - Patsy Ng: if you want to be really fussy about it we also accidentally got matching ice cream afterwards

they were ordering for both of us and i wasn't paying attention bc the prices weren't listed _anywhere_ in the shop and i was trying to find them so i just said "lemon sorbet on a normal cone" and they got lemon sorbet on a waffle cone
09/05/2022, 18:26 - Patsy Ng: the what
09/05/2022, 18:26 - Damien Fung: 😳👉👈
09/05/2022, 18:27 - Cindy Yang: aw funky
09/05/2022, 18:28 - Damien Fung: people started memeing how some edgy guys say sigma male all the time and this one song keeps on getting overlayed on the memes
09/05/2022, 18:29 - Cindy Yang: wack
09/05/2022, 18:29 - Cindy Yang: shrigma male
09/05/2022, 18:30 - Patsy Ng: that sounds like a type of mushroom
09/05/2022, 18:30 - Cindy Yang: probably toxic
09/05/2022, 18:30 - Patsy Ng: hh
09/05/2022, 18:30 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 18:31 - Cindy Yang: nice
09/05/2022, 18:31 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
09/05/2022, 18:33 - Cindy Yang: bruh
09/05/2022, 18:34 - Damien Fung: oh did i tell y'all that i also worked as an anti wingman
09/05/2022, 18:34 - Cindy Yang: lmao how
09/05/2022, 18:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: a legman
09/05/2022, 18:39 - Damien Fung: so friend and i were leaving class and she was like "I'm hungry. wanna get food? meeting a friend i met a few days ago"  so we got food and found the friend. the moment he saw me his expression completely changed

few minutes later she leaves the table to use the bathroom and the guy's conversation meter drops to 0 and so i try to talk to him but he just shrugs off all the questions

fast forward a day he keeps on sending really weird complements like "you're the world to me"

fast forward to career night friend is hosting and i coincidentally sit next to him. caught him staring at her the whole night

then a few days later friend gets creeped out bc of how incel/nice guy like he is and asks me what to do so we're just trying to think of a way to tell him to stop but it doesn't work so she has to cut off all contact with him
09/05/2022, 18:40 - Patsy Ng: wait sending weird compliments to the friend right
09/05/2022, 18:40 - Patsy Ng: not you
09/05/2022, 18:40 - Cindy Yang: yikeeees
09/05/2022, 18:40 - Damien Fung: yeah
09/05/2022, 18:41 - Patsy Ng: was she using you as an anti-wingman intentionally the first time round or
09/05/2022, 18:41 - Damien Fung: during our stats exam he just sat right in front of our friend group and tried chatting her up but i helped bail her out by talking to the guy instead
09/05/2022, 18:41 - Patsy Ng: who tries chatting people up during an _exam_
09/05/2022, 18:42 - Damien Fung: nah she didn't know. i smelled simpery the moment he was just with me at the table
09/05/2022, 18:42 - Damien Fung: like right before the exam
09/05/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: wack
09/05/2022, 18:42 - Damien Fung: like in the 5 mins where people are finding seats
09/05/2022, 18:42 - Cindy Yang: damn
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: we both talked about smth being fishy right after
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Patsy Ng: that's still annoying 

like you wanna be focused in the five mins before your exam
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: he left early tho bc he didn't know what to do
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: it wasn't even a hard exam bc the practice was 90% similar
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Cindy Yang: is he still bothering her
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: like turnitin would be angry
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Cindy Yang: lmao rip
09/05/2022, 18:43 - Damien Fung: nah he's gone now
09/05/2022, 18:44 - Cindy Yang: gud
09/05/2022, 18:44 - Patsy Ng: this is such a great way to describe similarities
09/05/2022, 18:44 - Patsy Ng: i'm stealing it
09/05/2022, 18:44 - Patsy Ng: i'm gonna make turnitin angry
09/05/2022, 18:45 - Damien Fung: use the pickup lines i supplied hehe
09/05/2022, 18:46 - Damien Fung: hmmm now that i think about it. isabel and i's pickup lines devolved from cheesy one liners to literal "no u" jokes
09/05/2022, 18:46 - Damien Fung: "you're cute"
"no u"
"no u"
"no u"
"no u"
09/05/2022, 18:47 - Patsy Ng: that's not even a pickup line that's just. a statement
09/05/2022, 18:47 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
09/05/2022, 18:47 - Damien Fung: alternatively it's **boop**
09/05/2022, 18:48 - Patsy Ng: like typing **boop** out in text or physically booping each other
09/05/2022, 18:48 - Damien Fung: physically
09/05/2022, 18:49 - Patsy Ng: hmm don't think i do physical contact with my friends here much

i do get like. biweekly hugs from one of the project leaders at transition tho
09/05/2022, 18:51 - Damien Fung: yeah I don't either except for one friend
09/05/2022, 18:51 - Damien Fung: very nice hugs
09/05/2022, 18:51 - Patsy Ng: do you think it's bc we all got weirded out about touching other people bc covid or because we're all incredibly touch-averse
09/05/2022, 18:52 - Damien Fung: probably covid
09/05/2022, 18:52 - Damien Fung: i was cool with people being physically close before covid but after social distancing i just forgot about that
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Tara: I hated it until now
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Damien Fung: now with things mostly back to normal it's whatever everyone else is cool with
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Tara: A couple of weeks ago I hugged my friend _twice£
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Tara: _twice_
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Damien Fung: nice nice
09/05/2022, 18:53 - Damien Fung: friends and i were touching each other's facial hair the other day for some reason
09/05/2022, 18:54 - Damien Fung: out of the 3 of us who went to five guys that night i was the only one with a gf and the only one without any facial hair and also not in cs
09/05/2022, 18:55 - Damien Fung: weird experience but funky
09/05/2022, 18:57 - Patsy Ng: wait how did they touch your facial hair if it was nonexistent then
09/05/2022, 18:57 - Damien Fung: they just touched my smooth face

10/05/2022, 16:57 - Cindy Yang: yayyy

10/05/2022, 17:08 - Damien Fung: eyyyyyyyy
10/05/2022, 17:08 - Damien Fung: comeback stories are funky

10/05/2022, 17:09 - Cindy Yang: nicee
10/05/2022, 17:10 - Patsy Ng: fun
10/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: hmm did not think i'd end up having to actually use the aviation alphabet in real life

needed to call the nhs to get my covid pass login and the line was bad so i had to spell stuff out
10/05/2022, 18:10 - Patsy Ng: oh wow the reason i couldn't get my username was bc they truncated my first name

it's legally "pui hang patsy" but they just. slapped "pui" in
10/05/2022, 18:10 - Patsy Ng: this also makes it extremely funny when officials ask for my first name and i give them this monstrosity and then they ask for my last name and it's two letters
10/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: bruh
10/05/2022, 18:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lmao
10/05/2022, 18:11 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh lol yeah I can never recover passwords because they expect me to remember the exact format I put my name in
10/05/2022, 18:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which depends on
10/05/2022, 18:12 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What a given company requires from name entry
10/05/2022, 18:13 - Tara: wait how
10/05/2022, 18:14 - Patsy Ng: instead of saying stuff like "p a t s y" i had to say "papa alpha tango sierra yankee"
10/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: oh i see
10/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: in BC the gov just made our IDs and the phone app as authentication keys so every time you wanna log into a government service website you just use the app instead of entering anything
10/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: really cool stuff
10/05/2022, 18:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yeah HK vax proof just requires your ID card and a face scan
10/05/2022, 18:19 - Patsy Ng: hmm wait did y'all hear about the face scanning code they found in the leavehomesafe app

like it's not activated or commented out or sth but like. there was a whole uproar about it like last week
10/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: lol oof
10/05/2022, 18:20 - Damien Fung: wait what?
10/05/2022, 18:20 - Damien Fung: like for data collection?
10/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Y'all ever look at the situation for overseas Russians and be like "damn I hope this doesn't happen with us"
10/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: wait pain
10/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: when i got the booster show they were like "yeah this counts as your booster shot!" but on the site it records my booster as my first shot
10/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: and hk isn't on the list of approved countries
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Patsy Ng: ? you mean the fleeing or the stigmatization
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: If it helps my booster card got me into France
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The latter
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The former too
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: The like
10/05/2022, 18:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I imagine it must be difficult to go home
10/05/2022, 18:23 - Patsy Ng: did you get a physical copy or are you just using the app
10/05/2022, 18:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Physical
10/05/2022, 18:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I legit thought I wasn't gonna get to cross the border because I realised I had kept my hkid at home for safekeeping
10/05/2022, 18:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But I had the booster card
10/05/2022, 18:24 - Tara: ???
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: they let you in without proper ID but they accepted your booster card
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh did I post
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No like I brought my passport
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But for Vax proof
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Tara: ah
10/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: you sent it here yeah
10/05/2022, 18:29 - Patsy Ng: wait hold up what do you mean by card
10/05/2022, 18:29 - Patsy Ng: the only options i have are request a paper copy, download a pdf, or use the app
10/05/2022, 18:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They gave me a card after my booster
10/05/2022, 18:34 - Patsy Ng: hmm wales must be different
10/05/2022, 18:34 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
10/05/2022, 18:38 - Patsy Ng: wacko
10/05/2022, 18:39 - Patsy Ng: anyway the app doesn't work for phones made before may 2019 so rip going with the electronic copy
10/05/2022, 18:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I'm obsessed with this scene in a book I'm reading
10/05/2022, 18:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Where a couple in the house next door are having an argument so the protagonist and their landlady switch off the lights in their own home so that they might watch through the window unobserved
10/05/2022, 18:40 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And they like get tea and chocolate and spectate
10/05/2022, 18:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But things get more serious so they call a cop, but the cop is like "it's maybe not a good idea to break it up right at this moment bc it will only cause more trouble?"
10/05/2022, 18:41 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And so the cop sits with them on the stairway and eats chocolates and drinks tea with them as he also spectates on the row
10/05/2022, 18:42 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Movie theatre vibes
10/05/2022, 18:42 - Patsy Ng: what book is it
10/05/2022, 18:43 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>

11/05/2022, 17:19 - Patsy Ng: it's like. uni-specific storage for just st andrews so that explains how they can be so efficient but _damn_ that is extremely efficient
11/05/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Same. I like spicy food a lot now, probably because there isn't much flavour elsewhere in Wales

11/05/2022, 17:34 - Tara: no*
11/05/2022, 17:34 - Patsy Ng: especially when it's like. that eggplant dish that's drowned in chili sauce

11/05/2022, 17:35 - Tara: i like it that way too
11/05/2022, 17:35 - Tara: chilli sauce makes everything better
11/05/2022, 17:35 - Patsy Ng: so whenever mom cooks it she like. shoves all the chili on half of the plate and then she laughs at me when i have to strike the balance of not setting my mouth on fire and eating the tasty spicy ones
11/05/2022, 17:35 - Cindy Yang: oof

12/05/2022, 15:15 - Cindy Yang: how was it
12/05/2022, 15:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: And he was like "I would actually really enjoy this if it didn't cost so much" and I had to tell him like
12/05/2022, 15:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: You can literally just get jars from Korea
12/05/2022, 15:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: For the same price the ramen place was charging us you can get like, at least ten glasses' worth if you're gonna go to the effort of cooling it and all that
12/05/2022, 15:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh the ramen was good
12/05/2022, 15:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But charging for water when serving even mildly spicy food ought to be illegal!
12/05/2022, 15:17 - Cindy Yang: rip
12/05/2022, 15:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Belgium moment
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: What's yuzu lemonade
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: How is it different from Western lemonade
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I googled it and the sth sth sth minister of Flanders apparently said at some point like "we recommend eating establishments provide free tap water but it's up to them"
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which like
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: well, yuzus are not lemons

12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Ah
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Ok
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Have you tried nimbu pani
12/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: It literally translates to lemon water
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: But specifically yujacha is made by pickling yuzus in sugar
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: In Korea anyway
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It turns into this marmalade type thing
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Tara: Love how all countries have their own take on citrus drinks
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Tara: Love it
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which you mix with hot water to get a sort of honey-lemon-tea vibe
12/05/2022, 15:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I always have a jar in my room in case I get a cold
12/05/2022, 15:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Yuja being Korean for yuzu

12/05/2022, 15:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A cultural exchange cooking party
12/05/2022, 15:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like we all go to my house, cook a bunch of foods and then we eat around a table in the garden
12/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: remember we nearly did this for tanushree's leaving lunch
12/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: let us retry
12/05/2022, 15:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, I'm generally better at Chinese food than Korean food but it could be fun
12/05/2022, 15:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Chinesewashed 😅
12/05/2022, 15:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
12/05/2022, 15:22 - Tara: give it a taste of real fire
12/05/2022, 15:22 - Martin Lee-Paterson: like half of Korean food is just Chinese food or Japanese food anyway
12/05/2022, 16:15 - Cindy Yang: that would be cool but i’d have to learn how to cook first lmao
12/05/2022, 16:15 - Damien Fung: uhhhh

12/05/2022, 16:15 - Damien Fung: i can cook decently well

12/05/2022, 16:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I can't cook anything very well but I can practice one single dish until it's edible
12/05/2022, 16:16 - Damien Fung: i shall make smash burgers

12/05/2022, 16:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think I ought to learn to make proper ramen at some point. I paid a fortune for some yesterday so I need to rationalise it as a business expense
12/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: shocking
12/05/2022, 16:20 - Cindy Yang: <Media omitted>
12/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: bro
12/05/2022, 16:20 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Weeb

12/05/2022, 16:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also I am gonna make my mother teach me to cook fish

12/05/2022, 16:39 - Patsy Ng: my brain is stuttering to a halt bc the only fish dishes we have at home besides like. salmon or fish paste are steamed fish or fried fish and fried fish is only good bc it's drowned in fried ginger (more ginger than fish) and steamed fish is Bad
12/05/2022, 16:53 - Damien Fung: we have like 1 canadian dish and it's literally fries, cheese, and gravy

12/05/2022, 17:15 - Cindy Yang: just get one mg
12/05/2022, 17:15 - Patsy Ng: that was due to the direction of the spiral

while walking on the right you were walking on the inside of the staircase when going up, which meant you didn't have to walk as much due to like. the way circles work
12/05/2022, 17:15 - Damien Fung: dude i probably get at least 5 from second hand weed around van

12/05/2022, 17:17 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Maybe I just don't respect my body
12/05/2022, 17:17 - Damien Fung: sample size is now irrelevant
12/05/2022, 17:17 - Cindy Yang: u mean normal cig smoke? no cos they beat it into our heads how bad smoking was
12/05/2022, 17:18 - Cindy Yang: so i was just like ew

12/05/2022, 17:19 - Damien Fung: how does the 69 position logistically work
12/05/2022, 17:19 - Damien Fung: with height differences it must be uncomfy
12/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: ngl never thought about that
12/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: i suppose
12/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: idk
12/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: do it on the side?
12/05/2022, 17:20 - Tara: so you can bend more??

12/05/2022, 17:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like you get bored
12/05/2022, 17:21 - Damien Fung: hmm
12/05/2022, 17:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That might be the ADHD tho

12/05/2022, 17:22 - Tara: yeah
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: i assume it is similar?
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Cindy Yang: idk
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Tara: never talked about this with uni friends phew
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Tara: the vibe is different
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Damien Fung: like it ain't gross and it ain't comedic gold
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Tara: this conversation is hypothetical for most of us presumably
12/05/2022, 17:22 - Damien Fung: oh I've done weird convos with uni friends
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Actually sex is pretty boring
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's more exciting to have done it
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or to be doing it
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Tara: noo i cant say that anymore dammit
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Rather than the actual rubbing and tugging
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Tara: wdym
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Tara: sex is boring unless you're doing it?
12/05/2022, 17:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No like
12/05/2022, 17:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Physiologically it's just fine
12/05/2022, 17:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Whatever

12/05/2022, 17:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like kissing I guess
12/05/2022, 17:24 - Damien Fung: <Media omitted>
12/05/2022, 17:24 - Cindy Yang: funky
12/05/2022, 17:25 - Tara: ok cool

12/05/2022, 17:26 - Damien Fung: i feel like the emotional part of sex is more appealing than the physical part
12/05/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I don't even have the apps anymore it's like, dating is annoying
12/05/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Whatever will happen will happen

12/05/2022, 17:26 - Tara: but everyone else is so like
12/05/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I did that one time, I brought a friend's vodka bottle as my water bottle and just chugged
12/05/2022, 17:26 - Tara: not fun to hang out with unless you're also drunk
12/05/2022, 17:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It was funnt

12/05/2022, 17:27 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Perhaps on some level I am some variety of ace
12/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
12/05/2022, 17:27 - Tara: i have no idea which is really annoying

12/05/2022, 17:29 - Tara: here as in me
12/05/2022, 17:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Lately I've been finding my identity in literature, and figuring out what other people were doing before me
12/05/2022, 17:29 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It turns out people in the 20th century didn't know what they were doing either thank god
12/05/2022, 17:29 - Damien Fung: lmaooooooo
12/05/2022, 17:30 - Cindy Yang: nice

17/05/2022, 18:03 - Tara: ELEC
17/05/2022, 18:04 - Tara: Wow
17/05/2022, 18:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no because I would veto mine
17/05/2022, 18:04 - Tara: Sounds like chubby
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Patsy Ng: i made an exception to my rule of using photos i was there for for you so i could use one of the "wir suchen dich" photos since they are fluent in german
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Damien Fung: oh yeah I'm waiting for my minor application to go through so hopefully I'll be a statistics major + data science minor soon
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Tara: I know this girl called Chhavi but I always thought her name was Chubby
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: oh that's good bc the wir suchen dich photos are actually really good
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Patsy Ng: yeah ik
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Tara: I also thought Sarbani was Bunny
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which did you go for tho
17/05/2022, 18:05 - Damien Fung: damn pat are you sure you're using meme photos of us
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Tara: Because her nickname is Bunny
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Tara: Bani*
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Martin Lee-Paterson: One has a funnier face and another has better text
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: i knew you'd die inside if i didn't use a photo that fed into your vanity
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Damien Fung: seems like you're using the flattering photos
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: i mean. i'm using photos with dumbass energy but i'm not going for meme photos bc. like. first impressions and all
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: so i'm trying to find a balance
17/05/2022, 18:06 - Damien Fung: good point
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I recommend you use the one where DICH is in cursive red
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Because the poster is funnier
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Tara: My actions on the call tomorrow shall cement my role as the groupchat dummy /s
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: It's like, we're not just suchen anything, it's DICH specifically
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Tara: /hj*
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Patsy Ng: i think i used the other one bc it focuses slightly more on your face
17/05/2022, 18:07 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also reasonable
17/05/2022, 18:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Both are good choices
17/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: i;m cropping the photos so they're more passport photo sized so that one would make your face too small

and since the doc's purpose is to like. make it easier to recognize y'all and remember what you do, that would defeat the purpose
17/05/2022, 18:08 - Tara: I wonder what photo of mine shows off dumbass energy
I have a feeling it's from year 11
17/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: also you have no idea how hard it is to find photos of people's faces after 2020
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Patsy Ng: no
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: it do be like that
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Patsy Ng: yours is from 2020
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Tara: Damn
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: we went on group outings like 3 times in pandemic times
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Tara: Yep
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Damien Fung: 4 if you count grad
17/05/2022, 18:09 - Tara: So sad
17/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: we gotta double that number this summer
17/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: minimum
17/05/2022, 18:10 - Tara: Damn last time I saw y'all was only last year wtf
17/05/2022, 18:10 - Damien Fung: 2020 for me and rishibh
17/05/2022, 18:10 - Tara: Seems like it's been aeons
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah i think this summer might be the last time i'm in hk for the next five years
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Damien Fung: damn how come?
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Patsy Ng: parents want me to get a bno so i'll have to stay in the uk for five years in a row
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Damien Fung: o o f
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: ???
17/05/2022, 18:11 - Patsy Ng: so yeah we're Doing Stuff
17/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: Absolutely
17/05/2022, 18:12 - Damien Fung: wait so like you can't leave the UK?
17/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: I'm not gonna be here in July so I'm prioritising you guys smh
17/05/2022, 18:12 - Damien Fung: smart move to get a BNO buy surely you can leave for a bit
17/05/2022, 18:12 - Damien Fung: think the grace period for getting canadian citizenship is like 60 days without being in canada
17/05/2022, 18:13 - Tara: Stay an additional five years after graduating or?
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Damien Fung: might not be on the table by then or smth
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Patsy Ng: from when you apply

bno applications open in october so from then i guess
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: Aw
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Patsy Ng: i think you can go on short vacations but i haven't read the rules yet
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Damien Fung: ahhh
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: RIP I need to make more friends here then
I would have to anyway
17/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: But more
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Tara: For some reason I assumed y'all would come back to HK but that's probably not the case
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: 5 years for citizenship is quite a while considering the BNO is supposed to let you obtain one faster
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Patsy Ng: i think damien and i will get out of quarantine at around june 13? we're quarantining within days of each other

so that leaves us two weeks to make it a whirlwind summer
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: like to become american you need 7 years
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: for Canada it's 3
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: and that's without any benefits
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Damien Fung: 1 week quarantine?
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Tara: Yes we need to plan this well
17/05/2022, 18:15 - Patsy Ng: home quarantine

17/05/2022, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: oh yeah @y'all i'm gonna put pronouns on the doc

17/05/2022, 18:18 - Damien Fung: can't seem to find anything about it on gov website???
17/05/2022, 18:18 - Tara: Is it like a self imposed quarantine
17/05/2022, 18:19 - Tara: Aight
17/05/2022, 18:19 - Damien Fung: like you gotta self monitor but that ain't quarantine
17/05/2022, 18:19 - Tara: There was a dude in Sandeepti's Lang class who gave a pitch on something called a PISSCUP
17/05/2022, 18:19 - Tara: Lemme find the slide
17/05/2022, 18:19 - Damien Fung: oh no
17/05/2022, 18:20 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/05/2022, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: ok rereading the site and it says "self-monitoring"
17/05/2022, 18:20 - Tara: so he seems fun
17/05/2022, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: which is Odd bc i've been keeping up with the rules and it def said 7 days home quarantine a couple days ago
17/05/2022, 18:21 - Damien Fung: huh it said self monitoring the last time i checked but that was a few weeks ago
17/05/2022, 18:21 - Damien Fung: the government is gaslighting us
17/05/2022, 18:21 - Damien Fung: well either way
17/05/2022, 18:22 - Damien Fung: 7 day quarantine and we're free!

17/05/2022, 18:53 - Patsy Ng: aight
17/05/2022, 18:54 - Patsy Ng: kudos if you can guess which points y'all've in common with remy (tried to include stuff you guys could talk about)

18/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: it's funny how exams are seen as a threat by our brain now
18/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: our priorities really shifted huh
18/05/2022, 21:21 - Tara: bruh

18/05/2022, 21:21 - Tara: (significant figure)
18/05/2022, 21:29 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
18/05/2022, 22:45 - Patsy Ng: I'm fucking livid y'all remember the person who was creeping about in my flat while we were calling

they came in while I went out after lunch and they took what was evidently a massive dump in the toilet bc there's shut stain on the side and like. a shit crumb on the seat?
18/05/2022, 22:47 - Cindy Yang: 😬😬
18/05/2022, 22:53 - Tara: The fuck
18/05/2022, 22:53 - Tara: Bro
18/05/2022, 22:53 - Tara: What
18/05/2022, 22:54 - Patsy Ng: tldr my last flatmate left this morning so it's just me in the flat

but in the middle of the call we heard someone. walking around and opening doors

didn't go check bc awkward
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Patsy Ng: but i think. if i hear someone entering later i am def gonna go confront them bc that was just _gross_
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Is this trespassing
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Tara: Could you complain
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Patsy Ng: no there aren't any door locks for the main flat
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Tara: That's so gross
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Patsy Ng: i could but it's not worth the fuss atm
18/05/2022, 22:55 - Tara: At least clean up after yourself 🤢🤢
18/05/2022, 22:56 - Patsy Ng: also it would involve me going to registration, which is where the creepy porter is
18/05/2022, 22:56 - Tara: Creepy porter rings a bell
18/05/2022, 22:56 - Tara: How are they creepy again?
18/05/2022, 22:56 - Tara: Is there a lot of lingering
18/05/2022, 22:56 - Patsy Ng: kept asking where i lived, down to street-level detail to see if he'd been there before
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Patsy Ng: also other reasons but that's the main one
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Tara: Yikes
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Tara: So many creepers
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Tara: Stay safe
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Patsy Ng: he's left off it and is now after me to bring him a postcard from stanley, where the military barracks used to be
18/05/2022, 22:57 - Patsy Ng: i'm not gonna do it
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Nein
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Bad
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Wired
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Weird*
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Patsy Ng: anyway we need to go to stanley as a group and make better memories of stanley than the focus of creepy porter's creepy requests
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Ohh HK Stanley
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: I thought there was one in st Andrew's
18/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Scotland*
18/05/2022, 22:59 - Tara: Good idea
18/05/2022, 22:59 - Tara: They have new restaurants there

18/05/2022, 22:59 - Cindy Yang: lmaooo
18/05/2022, 23:00 - Patsy Ng: fudge i keep calling it registration

reception

i meant reception
18/05/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: i just keep calling it that after seven years of having registration in the mornings it's just. the word i automatically say when i need a word that begins with r and ends with tion
18/05/2022, 23:01 - Tara: Remember the chocolate milk I had today
18/05/2022, 23:01 - Patsy Ng: yeah
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: I feel like I should not anymore because I feel nauseous after
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: And it's not expired or anything
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Patsy Ng: join the lactose intolerant gang
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Yep
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Excited to join
18/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: My digestive system hates me
18/05/2022, 23:03 - Tara: Because when I was on campus my second favourite drink was chocolate milk
18/05/2022, 23:03 - Tara: After water
18/05/2022, 23:03 - Patsy Ng: also the chocolate milk was like. six hours ago why is the reaction so delayed
18/05/2022, 23:03 - Tara: No it wasn't
Just decided to tell yall now
18/05/2022, 23:03 - Patsy Ng: wacko
18/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: I have an adverse reaction to chocolate milk and soft cheese
18/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: Which sucks
Because I love both of them
18/05/2022, 23:04 - Patsy Ng: what about hard cheese
18/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: I'm good with feta, halloumi, paneer
18/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: Don't really eat other hard cheeses
18/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Hmm
18/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: I'm good with mozzarella
18/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Bruh idk
18/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Some cheeses I cannot handle
Others I can
18/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: I fear this is Tmi sorry y'all
18/05/2022, 23:06 - Patsy Ng: it's fine this convo literally started with me ranting about shit stains
18/05/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Fair enough
18/05/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Well it's not gonna stop me from eating cheese
18/05/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Milk yes
18/05/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Actually I feel like if I drink plain milk from somewhere that's not HK then I might die
18/05/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Because it's way richer
18/05/2022, 23:07 - Patsy Ng: yeah i would die if i didn't dilute my milk with tea
18/05/2022, 23:08 - Tara: In the UK I can only drink semi-skim milk
18/05/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Because it's the closest to HK milk
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: God no
Father used to drink skim milk in HK
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: That's like
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: Water
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Patsy Ng: i've discussed it with other hk people and we all came to this conclusion

i still get full fat milk tho bc i refuse to give in to the skim milk
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Patsy Ng: disgostang
18/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: How's that working out for you
18/05/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Full fat milk
18/05/2022, 23:10 - Patsy Ng: again, the tea
18/05/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Ah right
18/05/2022, 23:10 - Tara: I feel bad for international students / expats
18/05/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Ugh hate HK
Can't even enjoy Indian food properly
18/05/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Because it's too rich
18/05/2022, 23:12 - Patsy Ng: ?
18/05/2022, 23:12 - Tara: The rest of the fam loves amul products
18/05/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Amul is a dairy company in India
18/05/2022, 23:13 - Tara: And they make stuff with amul butter / paneer / milk
18/05/2022, 23:13 - Tara: But I hate it all
18/05/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Because I'm used to plain tasteless milk
18/05/2022, 23:14 - Patsy Ng: wait how come saloni isn't also used to the plain tasteless milk
18/05/2022, 23:14 - Tara: I dunno
She lived in India and Japan for a bit
18/05/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Then came to HK
18/05/2022, 23:14 - Tara: By then maybe she was used to better dairy?
18/05/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Or she's not as picky as me idk
18/05/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Ok goodnight
18/05/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Gonna read for a bit
18/05/2022, 23:16 - Patsy Ng: night
18/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Thanks for the call btw it was nice seeing y'all
18/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: And remy
18/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: They were very nice
18/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Are they your uni bestie
18/05/2022, 23:18 - Patsy Ng: i guess, yeah?
18/05/2022, 23:18 - Patsy Ng: i don't really do "besties"

it's more like each friendship has diff vibes
18/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Fair enough
18/05/2022, 23:53 - Patsy Ng: creepy porter guy just did stuff to the flatmate who just left's room

what if. it was. the creepy porter this morning
18/05/2022, 23:54 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oof
19/05/2022, 01:20 - Tara: <Media omitted>
19/05/2022, 02:07 - Rishibh Prakash: this is sacrilegious
19/05/2022, 04:40 - Damien Fung: hmmm

19/05/2022, 04:41 - Damien Fung: my uncle probably just went out but I'm like 2 floors away from it
19/05/2022, 04:41 - Patsy Ng: wait so it connects whenever your car's engine starts up?
19/05/2022, 04:41 - Damien Fung: yessir
19/05/2022, 04:42 - Damien Fung: for the gps and whatnot
19/05/2022, 04:42 - Patsy Ng: wacko
19/05/2022, 04:42 - Damien Fung: gotta sneak in my Spotify tunes
19/05/2022, 07:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Hot take: the reason "netflix and chill" is a euphemism for fucking at this point is that having sex is a lot less work than trying to find something worth watching on Netflix
19/05/2022, 07:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They don't have *anything* anymore it's wild
19/05/2022, 07:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: src: had somebody over tonight and we gave up on trying to watch TV bc like... There isn't anything on TV
19/05/2022, 07:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean, there's stuff that I've already seen I guess

19/05/2022, 23:42 - Patsy Ng: for context we have to weigh items when we take them / sort them and we've had massive arguments about how much we think things weigh
19/05/2022, 23:42 - Patsy Ng: the worst guess was this giant bag of clothes

someone guessed 30 kg

it was 95 kg
19/05/2022, 23:43 - Patsy Ng: idk probably?
19/05/2022, 23:43 - Damien Fung: yeah we definitely can. just gotta do tests every day or smth

19/05/2022, 23:45 - Tara: How do you have 95kg of clothes
19/05/2022, 23:45 - Damien Fung: yeah hk gov websites are so shite

19/05/2022, 23:46 - Patsy Ng: we get donations and sort them into the type of clothing

that bag was the bag of free stuff (people usually have to pay for clothes but that bag was clothes that were still good but people probably wouldn't get them if they had to pay for them)
19/05/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Ah ok fair enough y'all have actual winters
19/05/2022, 23:47 - Damien Fung: i just pack so much in my laundry bags and so that i only wash once a week or so

21/05/2022, 17:25 - Patsy Ng: which is good
21/05/2022, 17:26 - Patsy Ng: I have so much stuff tho

mainly due to the unexpected roller skates

I'm kind of proud that I managed to stuff my laptop, uni notes + textbooks, iPad, and the skating helmet all in my schoolbag tho
21/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: noice
21/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: are you skating now
21/05/2022, 17:27 - Patsy Ng: I also have one of those waterproof roll-top bags that is full of stolen food from the canteen

21/05/2022, 17:27 - Cindy Yang: become someone who skates everywhere
21/05/2022, 17:27 - Patsy Ng: it would like. take a third of the weight from my suitcase probably
21/05/2022, 17:28 - Patsy Ng: if check-in at the airport says my stuff is too heavy I might genuinely try wearing the roller skates to fly
21/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo
21/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: probably not allowed sadly
21/05/2022, 17:34 - Cindy Yang: also ughhh i was only trying four number combos but actually i think my pin was at least six
21/05/2022, 17:34 - Patsy Ng: yeah
21/05/2022, 17:35 - Patsy Ng: found a roller skating blog based in the UK and they said you have to check them in bc sometimes airport security views them as blunt weapons

22/05/2022, 00:24 - Patsy Ng: textbooks are like half a cm thin
22/05/2022, 00:27 - Tara: oh interesting
22/05/2022, 00:28 - Patsy Ng: I mean they give recommended reading
22/05/2022, 00:29 - Patsy Ng: but they're only sometimes textbooks and also everyone I've talked to has been so bogged down that they've never had time to do extra stuff
22/05/2022, 00:31 - Damien Fung: ahhhh

22/05/2022, 18:00 - Tara: https://www.londonxlondon.com/best-capsule-hotels-london/
check this out?
22/05/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: That goes in the safe
22/05/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Hostels generally just give you a bed
22/05/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I try to avoid them anyway, usually I tend to plan for the spare beds of friends and family
22/05/2022, 18:00 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or for those with no spare beds, sofas
22/05/2022, 18:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Or for certain friends, just their normal beds 💀
22/05/2022, 18:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oh you need to check if Chunks is around
22/05/2022, 18:01 - Martin Lee-Paterson: No relation I was just trying to remember if we knew anybody in London who you might want to see.
22/05/2022, 18:02 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Anyway hostel living is inoffensive mostly as long as you go home, immediately go to sleep, wake up, leave
22/05/2022, 18:03 - Patsy Ng: yeah we're meeting up

still need to plan but i thought i'd get figuring out where i'm gonna live out of the way first
22/05/2022, 18:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: This one was great because I never had to see and rarely heard anybody. If you go here try and get an upper bunk bc it's so exciting climbing the ladder
22/05/2022, 18:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Although you may bump your head
22/05/2022, 18:03 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Also free breakfast if you book direct but the food is kind of tragic
22/05/2022, 18:03 - Patsy Ng: you overestimate my height
22/05/2022, 18:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, scout camp vibes with mediocre white bread and various toppings, milk, cereal
22/05/2022, 18:04 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Technically a buffet but hardly fine dining
22/05/2022, 18:06 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 18:07 - Tara: are you taking everything with you to hk and back
22/05/2022, 18:07 - Patsy Ng: tbh i'm less concerned with food

my main issue is How Clean And Private are the Bathrooms
22/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: no i put some stuff in storage

the main weight is the roller skates

which i need to bring back for the summer if i want to use them
22/05/2022, 18:08 - Tara: ok cool
22/05/2022, 18:08 - Patsy Ng: also the blue on the half closest to me is a bag full of all the cows i've gotten while here
22/05/2022, 18:09 - Tara: wow
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Patsy Ng: oh no the dorms are gendered
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: clean enough
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: cubicles available
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: bring own soap
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: surely you should leave some cows in the UK and spend time with your hk cows back home?
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Tara: hey does anyone understand how forwarding tables work in dijkstra's
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Like, Remy can take care of William
22/05/2022, 18:20 - Patsy Ng: i'm integrating the herds
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Capsules are not
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: mm
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Capsule dorm is unisex
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Patsy Ng: capsules have gone up to 67 pounds per person tho
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Jesus
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Must be seasonal
22/05/2022, 18:22 - Patsy Ng: or i'm booking late
22/05/2022, 18:22 - Patsy Ng: as in it's cheaper when you book in advance
22/05/2022, 18:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Probably
22/05/2022, 18:23 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I think most hostels are gendered
22/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I mean technically it's non gendered vs female I think
22/05/2022, 18:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which has a kinda distressing gender politics to it
22/05/2022, 18:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I would look into cheap Hotels
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>

22/05/2022, 18:32 - Patsy Ng: anyway parents are Extremely against me sharing a bathroom with anyone
22/05/2022, 18:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: They can pay for a hotel then
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Patsy Ng: i think i'd be ok with dealing with sharing with a couple people for a couple nights
22/05/2022, 18:50 - Cindy Yang: anyone wanna see an x ray of my wack wisdom teeth
22/05/2022, 18:51 - Patsy Ng: sure

22/05/2022, 20:38 - Tara: Do you want to stay in a 12-person hostel room
22/05/2022, 20:39 - Patsy Ng: I am apprehensive but I also think it is an experience I should have
22/05/2022, 20:39 - Tara: Turn it into a Queen experience
22/05/2022, 20:39 - Tara: Oh no you haven't watched it
22/05/2022, 20:41 - Patsy Ng: explain?
22/05/2022, 20:42 - Tara: So some girl was gonna get married to some guy

22/05/2022, 20:43 - Patsy Ng: the character in question had them in the shells and dug the meat out with his pocket knife but I am assuming this is not going to be the case
22/05/2022, 20:43 - Tara: Can you eat it in a sandwich
22/05/2022, 20:44 - Patsy Ng: oh you meant seasoning
22/05/2022, 20:44 - Tara: No just generally
22/05/2022, 20:44 - Patsy Ng: I think there is garlic involved but I guess I'm gonna find out

she was like "I saw you walking down the street and double back and I knew you were from Hong Kong"

was Fun finding another hk person but also Stressful bc she was like "don't go out at night, it's not safe because there are loads of immigrants"

played dumb and went "but we're immigrants too" (she assumed I'd moved to London and I dislike people knowing where I live so I did not disillusion her)

25/05/2022, 01:46 - Patsy Ng: @people who drive how are you supposed to signal on a roundabout

was trying to cross one of the branches off and saw a car with it's turn signal going to the right (cars going anti clockwise) so I thought it was aight to cross but Apparently Not bc the driver ended up braking and mime raging at me
25/05/2022, 03:24 - Damien Fung: idk about uk but it depends on where they enter the roundabout
25/05/2022, 03:25 - Damien Fung: so if they wanna go forward they just signal right when they wanna exit
25/05/2022, 03:25 - Damien Fung: if they wanna go right they just signal before they enter
25/05/2022, 03:25 - Damien Fung: if they wanna go left they signal left before they enter then change the signal to right when they wanna exit
25/05/2022, 03:53 - Patsy Ng: <Media omitted>

25/05/2022, 04:34 - Damien Fung: i mean they'd probably have to signal left then? either way you should have right of way so it's their fault for not stopping for you

25/05/2022, 04:40 - Damien Fung: also holy shit y'all. just did an entry exam for a datathon and man was it hard
25/05/2022, 04:40 - Damien Fung: like i vaguely knew all the answers but all the choices seemed the exact same and they all worked too so it was guesswork half the time

25/05/2022, 23:34 - Rishibh Prakash: I have 0 memory of what the plot was
25/05/2022, 23:34 - Rishibh Prakash: Just curious
25/05/2022, 23:34 - Rishibh Prakash: Like the book had so little impact on me I don't even remember what happened in it
25/05/2022, 23:34 - Tara: Well you did write your essay on the outsider

25/05/2022, 23:34 - Tara: I do
25/05/2022, 23:34 - Tara: It was short

25/05/2022, 23:35 - Tara: I shall summarise
25/05/2022, 23:36 - Rishibh Prakash: You don't have to it's fine
25/05/2022, 23:36 - Rishibh Prakash: I was just wondering if people actually remembered the book
25/05/2022, 23:36 - Rishibh Prakash: Or whether it was just me
25/05/2022, 23:36 - Rishibh Prakash: Tbf I do have a terrible memory with these things sometimes
25/05/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: misread this as termite swim

25/05/2022, 23:48 - Patsy Ng: wait termites. can't fly tho?
25/05/2022, 23:49 - Patsy Ng: can they???
25/05/2022, 23:55 - Cindy Yang: they can apparently
25/05/2022, 23:56 - Cindy Yang: they grow wings specifically to swarm tho and then when they land the wings fall off
26/05/2022, 00:16 - Patsy Ng: Dislike
26/05/2022, 01:02 - Tara: So there's this wee fella in a medic's tent at some camp in an african nation and he decides to tell the doctor his story
so he was born into a poor family in some african nation (again im sorry i dont remember the names) and he had this uncle who decided to take him to another country to Earn Money
But when they got to the Other Country they were captured by some soldiers and I think the uncle was either killed or taken in with them
Anyway the kid was conscripted into some guy's army and the uncle was like selling fake talismans and scamming people
so like there was some conflict between these two groups and people died etc etc and when the army is defeated the kid goes with some other kids to the other army to fight for them
26/05/2022, 01:02 - Tara: and that happens a couple of times
26/05/2022, 01:02 - Tara: the uncle was killed at some point too
26/05/2022, 01:02 - Tara: because the talisman he gave the general killed him because he was an asshole
26/05/2022, 01:02 - Tara: and so they killed the uncle because they were like omg you charlatan
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Tara: a lot of kids died
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Tara: or were sexually assaulted
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Tara: including the protagonist
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Tara: by some lady
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Tara: anyway it was a horrific book
26/05/2022, 01:03 - Patsy Ng: wait are you using your swiss army knife scissors to cut thread
26/05/2022, 01:04 - Tara: yes the scissors are sharp
26/05/2022, 01:04 - Tara: and effective
26/05/2022, 01:04 - Patsy Ng: hmm interesting
26/05/2022, 01:04 - Patsy Ng: you know how people really into textiles are like. DO NOT USE MY FABRIC SCISSORS FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN SCISSORS ON PAIN OF DEATH

you're the opposite
26/05/2022, 01:05 - Tara: oops?
26/05/2022, 01:05 - Patsy Ng: no it's fine
26/05/2022, 01:06 - Patsy Ng: it means fabrics + threads are softer than whatever you normally cut so it doesn't make the scissors any blunter besides the normal wear and tear

but if you use fabric scissors on anything else then they get duller bc the stuff is harder, so it doesn't cut fabric as nicely anymore
26/05/2022, 01:08 - Patsy Ng: wait i just said do not use scissors on anything other than scissors

the second SCISSORS should be FABRIC
26/05/2022, 01:08 - Martin Lee-Paterson: no now I am going to use them on scissors
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: RIP sorry
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: But here you go anyway
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Keep in mind I do not remember most of the middle
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Besides
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Ooh ok
26/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: So they were trekking in the forest
Two of the kids were dating
The girl stepped on a mine(?) And her leg got blown off
So the other kids including her bf decided to abandon her
26/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: There was a lot of abuse in the book jeez
26/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: Also if anyone's interested
26/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: Friend and I decided to take an attachment type quiz

26/05/2022, 01:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: *fall
26/05/2022, 01:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Fall out
26/05/2022, 01:16 - Tara: Because neither of us are comfortable with it
26/05/2022, 01:16 - Tara: If I hadn't told you guys about the Childhood I would probably not tell you guys anything
26/05/2022, 01:17 - Tara: Sorry
26/05/2022, 01:17 - Patsy Ng: I mean then don't you just. skirt round topics
26/05/2022, 01:17 - Tara: Here's the extent of it barring this quiz
26/05/2022, 01:17 - Tara: Her: yo I'm gonna see a counsellor
Me: ok cool enjoy
No followup
26/05/2022, 01:18 - Tara: Like she says general stuff like oh the counsellor is great and insightful but she never tells me her own problems
26/05/2022, 01:18 - Tara: And I don't tell her my problems
26/05/2022, 01:19 - Tara: Boundaries ✨
26/05/2022, 01:19 - Tara: So healthy 10/10
26/05/2022, 01:19 - Tara: Sorry again because trauma dumping Bad
26/05/2022, 01:19 - Tara: Only gonna talk to Ayuko about it
26/05/2022, 01:22 - Patsy Ng: if you wanna talk about it for a bit now idm
26/05/2022, 01:23 - Tara: Oh no thank you I'm fine
26/05/2022, 01:23 - Tara: As you saw I've been having meh days which is good
26/05/2022, 01:25 - Patsy Ng: how exactly does that mood tracker thing work
26/05/2022, 01:25 - Tara: In the morning and evening it asks me how I'm feeling
26/05/2022, 01:25 - Tara: On a scale from 1-5
26/05/2022, 01:25 - Patsy Ng: are they equally weighted
26/05/2022, 01:26 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/05/2022, 01:26 - Tara: Yeah
26/05/2022, 01:26 - Tara: You can also manually add entries throughout the day
26/05/2022, 01:26 - Tara: I don't like this app UI though
26/05/2022, 01:26 - Patsy Ng: why are there so many levels when there are only 5 ratings
26/05/2022, 01:27 - Tara: Idfk
26/05/2022, 01:27 - Tara: It's weird
26/05/2022, 01:27 - Tara: And I can't see my past data
26/05/2022, 01:27 - Tara: Like what am I supposed to show Ayuko
26/05/2022, 01:27 - Tara: This is not indicative of my long term mood
26/05/2022, 01:28 - Patsy Ng: take a screenshot at the end of every month
26/05/2022, 01:28 - Patsy Ng: or start a bullet journal or sth
26/05/2022, 01:28 - Patsy Ng: added bonus of being artsy and calming
26/05/2022, 01:28 - Tara: Oh that's a great idea
26/05/2022, 01:29 - Tara: I have to pay to see the previous data like bro what
26/05/2022, 01:29 - Tara: That's awful
26/05/2022, 01:29 - Tara: What is the point
26/05/2022, 01:30 - Patsy Ng: it's how they make money i guess
26/05/2022, 01:30 - Patsy Ng: find a diff app?
26/05/2022, 01:30 - Tara: Yes I found a nicer looking app
26/05/2022, 01:30 - Tara: But it only reminds me once a day
26/05/2022, 01:30 - Tara: Instead of twice
26/05/2022, 01:31 - Tara: I mean tbh when I wake up I always feel meh
26/05/2022, 01:32 - Patsy Ng: yeah i feel like. the morning rating would depend greatly upon whether or not i'd had breakfast + tea yet
26/05/2022, 01:32 - Tara: I know one day I woke up happy
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Tara: But that's once in a blue moon
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Patsy Ng: oh wait no today i woke up terrified
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Patsy Ng: had a really weird dream
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Tara: Scuse me
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Tara: Are you ok
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Tara: What was the dream about
26/05/2022, 01:33 - Patsy Ng: ok terrified was the wrong word

more like. shocked in a negative way
26/05/2022, 01:34 - Tara: Ok
26/05/2022, 01:35 - Tara: So what did you dream about
26/05/2022, 01:35 - Tara: Wait you're typing sorry
26/05/2022, 01:40 - Patsy Ng: it was basically like. my brain was making a musical up for me to watch

it was about this family with three kids

i only got as far as the first song before i woke up due to being Shooketh

anyway the first song was the eldest kid (protag) doing all the exposition while being super excited and bouncing around on a bicycle doing a wheelie

the eldest two were like. average kids but for some reason the first one really wanted to be a genius so he could do cool stuff like. invent things and basically have a "superpower" to save the world and tried to do it by studying a lot and joining extracurricular activities and helping other people loads

but then the third kid came along and they seemed average at first but then he started talking and they all found out Oh This Kid Is A Genius

and the first kid was really sad about it

and the final song lines weren't sung at all, they were spoken, and the kid also stopped bouncing around like all the life had just drained out of him and they were basically "if [third kid] can do all that, then it means i just didn't try hard enough"

and that was when i woke up
26/05/2022, 01:41 - Tara: Oh no that's so sad
26/05/2022, 01:41 - Tara: The poor first kid
26/05/2022, 01:41 - Tara: He tried so hard 🥲
26/05/2022, 01:42 - Patsy Ng: yeah
26/05/2022, 01:42 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/05/2022, 01:42 - Patsy Ng: i think the musical's moral was going to be "it's useless being smart if you're not nice" tho

bc the third kid wasn't nice, he was just. smart

not mean either, just neutral
26/05/2022, 01:42 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/05/2022, 01:43 - Tara: Oh interesting
26/05/2022, 01:43 - Tara: That's true
26/05/2022, 01:44 - Tara: I hope they'll all turn out to be ok
26/05/2022, 01:44 - Tara: Even though they were mostly a figment of your imagination
26/05/2022, 01:44 - Tara: Ok it's nearly 2
26/05/2022, 01:44 - Tara: I'm going to sleep
26/05/2022, 01:44 - Tara: Sweet dreams
26/05/2022, 01:45 - Patsy Ng: i think the first kid might be based on some kids i passed while walking around yesterday

was walking from the battle of britain museum to the folkestone white horse and there were a couple of kids practising wheelies on the road
26/05/2022, 01:45 - Patsy Ng: good night
26/05/2022, 01:45 - Tara: Ah
26/05/2022, 01:45 - Tara: Ok I'm going to sleep but question: how was the museum is it worth visiting
26/05/2022, 01:49 - Patsy Ng: really intense

very chock full of detail, i arrived like. half an hour after it opened and left half an hour before it closed and i think the museum volunteers (it's entirely volunteer-run) got kind of worried about how long i spent in there bc they checked on me like three separate times and they said it takes about three weeks to read and process everything properly

anyway yeah really intense

not just information-density but also like. emotionally bc it's just stories and stories of how different pilots died

and all the uniforms on display are real and one of the volunteers told me that a pilot died in one of the jackets but only part of him bc his arms got ripped off in the crash
26/05/2022, 01:50 - Patsy Ng: they have goring's uniform btw

also lord dowding
26/05/2022, 01:50 - Tara: Oh wow that's very
26/05/2022, 01:50 - Tara: Hardcore
26/05/2022, 01:50 - Tara: Authentic
Raw
26/05/2022, 01:50 - Tara: Ok I'm going to add it to my list
26/05/2022, 01:51 - Tara: Thanks
26/05/2022, 01:56 - Patsy Ng: it's also. really masculine? idk how to put it

like all the stories, apart from one about a waaf lady, are about men and men doing things and responding to other men

and it's very. individualistic, like it tells stories about diff pilots like they act on their own unless they are in a squadron but even then it's like. they're the protag so it doesn't expand much on other people

like i asked where all the other stories were, like what happened to the waafs or the ground crew or the people making planes or whatever and they were like "we're just concentrating on the pilots bc it's the battle of britain"

and i chickened out of trying to explain more bc. they were very nice individually but. the type of people who are ww2 geeks are not usually Great

but what i was trying to get at is. yeah the pilots were super instrumental to the battle of britain

but they were part of a team

the battle of britian didn't just happen in isolation, there were people in the not-so-glamourous roles that helped and you can't really focus on just one bit of it because it's all connected

like. i want to find out more about the waafs who transported planes and supplies between bases! i want to find out about the people who made the planes! i want to find out more about the waaf plotters! i want to find out more about the groundcrew and what they had to do! i want to find out what the pilots did in their downtime! what they did between scrambles! like. the fighting is the _least_ interesting part
26/05/2022, 01:59 - Patsy Ng: oh also most of this is about pilots but there were some two-seater planes with a pilot and a gunner

and i didn't see anything specifically on gunners

just models with text touching on "this plane could accommodate a gunner"
26/05/2022, 02:04 - Patsy Ng: ooh there were some cool tactical bits on dogfight strategy tho

like apparently the raf started out in vic formation which is just a V with like. three planes bc that's what they were used to  (parade ground formation)

but that is Bad bc it makes each plane super easy to attack bc they all have to concentrate on not crashing into each other instead of evading attacks

so the looked at what the luftwaffe were doing which was flying in diagonal pairs, and copied them

which worked bc the attacker goes for the first plane, but doesn't notice the second plane bc it's too far behind

but the second plane can see the attacker bc they're in front

so the second plane tells the first plane which way to turn so the attacker will follow and put themselves in between the paired planes

then the second plane can gun down the attacker

anyway that was Cool to learn but i also don't like that i know it bc knowing ways to kill people isn't that fun
26/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: Oh that's interesting
26/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: What's WAAF
26/05/2022, 09:57 - Tara: Oh right

28/05/2022, 11:43 - Tara: Supposed to meet my friends after not seeing them for a while and I feel very anxious idk why
28/05/2022, 11:44 - Tara: It's either the thought of seeing them or my body is still in exam mode and thinks I have to study during the weekend
28/05/2022, 13:18 - Patsy Ng: it's a premonition they're gonna eat you
28/05/2022, 13:20 - Tara: Hmmm
28/05/2022, 13:21 - Tara: Hope not
28/05/2022, 13:52 - Patsy Ng: trying kombucha and why is it _fizzy_
28/05/2022, 13:54 - Damien Fung: isn't it slightly alcoholic?
28/05/2022, 13:55 - Patsy Ng: Oh
28/05/2022, 13:55 - Patsy Ng: I hust saw green tea and went "oh I will want caffeine in the morning"
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Patsy Ng: anyway maybe not this one? got it at tesco and I didn't get ided
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Damien Fung: nah it's like barely alcoholic
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Patsy Ng: oops
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Damien Fung: like 0.5%
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Patsy Ng: would it have to say?
28/05/2022, 13:56 - Damien Fung: american beer is like 5
28/05/2022, 13:57 - Damien Fung: probably?
28/05/2022, 13:57 - Damien Fung: it's probably only alcoholic bc it's fermented
28/05/2022, 13:57 - Patsy Ng: the bottle doesn't say anything about alcohol
28/05/2022, 13:57 - Damien Fung: and since bread also technically has a negligible amount of alcohol i guess it's except in that way too
28/05/2022, 13:58 - Patsy Ng: wacko
28/05/2022, 13:58 - Patsy Ng: douse the bread in wine
28/05/2022, 13:58 - Patsy Ng: not negligible anymore
28/05/2022, 13:59 - Patsy Ng: also actually fizzy not I-can't-tell-it's-alcohol fizzy

explode when I open it fizzy
28/05/2022, 14:41 - Tara: Never trust canned drinks
28/05/2022, 15:54 - Patsy Ng: it was bottled
28/05/2022, 15:54 - Tara: Never trust bottled drinks
28/05/2022, 17:36 - Patsy Ng: hh heathrow's tsa assigned me Boy Child status

detector went off and they were like "where's your mum or dad" and "[male colleague] will search you now"
28/05/2022, 17:40 - Patsy Ng: oh also forgot but when I left the youth hostel this morning I saw. the two french guys who I'd thought were a father-son pair were spooning in a very small single person bunk? like when we'd all went to sleep last night they were in diff beds

so like. the "son" moved in the middle of the night?

anyway I don't think they're a father-son pair anymore
28/05/2022, 17:44 - Patsy Ng: which was surreal bc I spent the tube ride to Heathrow helping out an economics professor reset her suitcase combo lock and she was like "are you a second year? I can just Tell because I've been teaching so long"
28/05/2022, 18:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ayyy
28/05/2022, 18:59 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Delicious!

28/05/2022, 19:25 - Patsy Ng: a sign around her neck that said "rich indian aunty"
28/05/2022, 20:26 - Tara: The selling point was the scarf
28/05/2022, 20:47 - Cindy Yang: a scarf??? in this weather??
28/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: Yes
28/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: I looked really good
28/05/2022, 21:13 - Cindy Yang: damn
28/05/2022, 21:13 - Cindy Yang: nice
28/05/2022, 21:48 - Cindy Yang: the framing device of frankenstein is so funny
28/05/2022, 21:49 - Cindy Yang: guy with really good memory writing down what another guy with really good memory says, some of which includes stuff that another guy with really good memory said
29/05/2022, 01:14 - Tara: Y'all

29/05/2022, 04:32 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Which means we will have missed each other by under a day
29/05/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: ? like. reminiscing or going down an actual lane called memory lane
29/05/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: in hk btw, just landed
29/05/2022, 08:58 - Patsy Ng: oh my god this is what. the third time we've just barely missed each other
29/05/2022, 09:03 - Patsy Ng: actually it feels like more
29/05/2022, 09:23 - Damien Fung: eyyy
29/05/2022, 09:28 - Patsy Ng: jeez half the stores at the airport are closed it feels apocalyptic

29/05/2022, 09:38 - Damien Fung: there's a chance warcus was on the same flight as you

29/05/2022, 09:39 - Patsy Ng: oh worm?

29/05/2022, 09:43 - Patsy Ng: dope
29/05/2022, 09:46 - Patsy Ng: wait I just had the really awful thought what if I've seen warcus but I don't recognize him after two years
29/05/2022, 09:48 - Damien Fung: looks the same i feel
29/05/2022, 09:49 - Patsy Ng: yeah but everyone is wearing masks
29/05/2022, 09:57 - Patsy Ng: behind this guy o the phone to his spouse and he's been whining about how long the line is for the last half hour
29/05/2022, 09:58 - Patsy Ng: like imagine taking the first phone call to your significant other for a while and you spend it complaining about waiting in line
29/05/2022, 10:06 - Patsy Ng: oh he's complaining about how air canada has ugly, low-energy staff now
29/05/2022, 10:06 - Patsy Ng: wonderful
29/05/2022, 10:36 - Tara: The former
29/05/2022, 10:36 - Tara: Bruh you really need to tell us about your travel plans wtf
29/05/2022, 11:09 - Martin Lee-Paterson: A lot of the time I don't even know them myself

29/05/2022, 11:16 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Everything else was bombed to shit in the war

29/05/2022, 11:18 - Martin Lee-Paterson: I already went to the one museum
29/05/2022, 11:21 - Martin Lee-Paterson: What would a domestic ww2 thing even look like
29/05/2022, 11:22 - Patsy Ng: yeah that's why I said interesting and not cool
29/05/2022, 11:23 - Patsy Ng: idk ww2 recruitment posters and bomb shelter models and rationing examples
29/05/2022, 11:23 - Patsy Ng: the battle of britain museum had a tiny room for that stuff (minus the shelters bc they were so large) and it was the most interesting room
29/05/2022, 11:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: "rationing examples" - me eating tragic meals bc broke from all the travelling
29/05/2022, 11:24 - Patsy Ng: tesco meal deals ftw
29/05/2022, 11:24 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Ooooh like a misc room?
29/05/2022, 11:25 - Patsy Ng: yeah I guess

they had diff gas mask styles too and it was really interesting to see the infant one

bc it wasn't a mask

it was straight up a cot bc babies are too small for masks
29/05/2022, 11:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
29/05/2022, 11:25 - Martin Lee-Paterson: Oooo
29/05/2022, 11:26 - Martin Lee-Paterson: <Media omitted>
29/05/2022, 12:06 - Patsy Ng: waiting is so much more bearable when I compare it to heathrow

currently on three hours to heathrow's six

and this. includes extra stuff like pcr and waiting for the bus to the quarantine hotel

@y'all who are travelling can also compare your times
29/05/2022, 12:18 - Cindy Yang: lmaoo do be like that
29/05/2022, 12:18 - Cindy Yang: looks cool tho

29/05/2022, 13:19 - Patsy Ng: based on the bus wait times (an hour and a half and counting) I suspect that a) the buses are 16-seaters and b) there is only one bus for this route (to cwb)
29/05/2022, 13:21 - Patsy Ng: alternatively they're 48-seater coaches but people aren't allowed to sit next to each other
