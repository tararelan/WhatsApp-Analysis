09/09/2021, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: It kinda makes it seem like homosexuality and being a pervert villain go hand in hand
09/09/2021, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is problematic
09/09/2021, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: But to be fair the manga is really old

09/09/2021, 18:43 - Sandeepti Singh: So it probably tells u how brutal that whole thing is
09/09/2021, 18:43 - Tara: why did they even have to add the sexual abuse at first
09/09/2021, 18:43 - Tara: fhfsrhrhsjh

09/09/2021, 18:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Like u do see ash grow as a character and start valuing himself
09/09/2021, 18:47 - Sandeepti Singh: But it’s a slow process with a lot of speed bumps
09/09/2021, 18:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Ughhh I wanna go watch it again but I know I’ll just cry
09/09/2021, 18:47 - Sandeepti Singh: But I’m happy you’re watching it

15/09/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: And for some reason it’s an insult hahah
15/09/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lol he is def a douche
15/09/2021, 19:31 - Tara: You should always have high standards when it comes to relationships / [redacted]
15/09/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah it was never a relationship
15/09/2021, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: I def have higher standards for relationship
15/09/2021, 19:33 - Tara: Go get those six pack abs and don't settle for anything less
15/09/2021, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Yes ma’am
15/09/2021, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oml the text u sent on the gc… I saw the notif  and thought u meant u wanted to take a pic of the dude
15/09/2021, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmaoooo
15/09/2021, 19:35 - Tara: Hahahah
15/09/2021, 19:35 - Tara: I would also die tbh
15/09/2021, 19:36 - Tara: Also my gallery has top notch photos I'm not defiling it with his face
15/09/2021, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao defiling
15/09/2021, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: okay question
15/09/2021, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: did you do the comp lab about codebreaking like that game mastermind
15/09/2021, 20:58 - Tara: Shoot me, child
15/09/2021, 20:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm stuck. it seems like a simple error but i can't figure out why
15/09/2021, 20:59 - Tara: the what now
15/09/2021, 20:59 - Tara: can you send the lab
15/09/2021, 20:59 - Tara: pls
15/09/2021, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: like do i copy the lab website's content ?
15/09/2021, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: or my code
15/09/2021, 21:00 - Tara: both
15/09/2021, 21:00 - Tara: you can save the page as a pdf
15/09/2021, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: cool
15/09/2021, 21:02 - Sandeepti Singh: i shared a google doc
15/09/2021, 21:02 - Sandeepti Singh: okay so i barely started lol
15/09/2021, 21:02 - Sandeepti Singh: and what i don't get is this... they want the user to enter 4 numbers for each attempt. So, my dowhile loop is going crazy and printing shit out like 4 times?
15/09/2021, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: oh waittt i think i shoud use more variables for the guesses
15/09/2021, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh yeah it'll be asier to compare it too then
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: i saw their expected output and assumed that I have to use one varibale
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think they just made the output that way so that it doesn't give the answer
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: that makes it so much easier
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Tara: did you add the cin >> attempt?
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: okay lol sorry for the spam lemme try and fix it myself first
15/09/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: yep
15/09/2021, 21:08 - Tara: oh ok
15/09/2021, 21:11 - Tara: ugh for some reason my laptop keeps scanning the file for viruses when i try running a program
15/09/2021, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh weird
15/09/2021, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: do you want me to copy past the code here so you can just copy it?
15/09/2021, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: but like lemme fix stuff first lol
15/09/2021, 21:12 - Tara: sure
15/09/2021, 21:12 - Tara: i'm working on the logic rn
15/09/2021, 21:14 - Tara: oh bleh the red/white pin thing is annoying
15/09/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah just figuring those out now
15/09/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: the method i have in mind seems length
15/09/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: lengthy but i'll do it like this first and later on try to think of something else
15/09/2021, 21:15 - Tara: same
15/09/2021, 21:27 - Tara: Did they mention how to handle the white pin in the case that for example g0 == g2 || g0 == g3
15/09/2021, 21:27 - Tara: like if the numbers were 1 2 3 3
and you write 3 0 0 0 
how many white pins do you have
15/09/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i dunno
15/09/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme look up the game
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i used ot play this game all the time before lol
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: hmm actually
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: based on the logic
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: it would just add 1
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: well the way i'm doing it at least
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: oh damn really
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: that's what i was thinking
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: was it fun
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: yep
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i had the physical game
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: and if you cracked it it would feel so good
15/09/2021, 21:28 - Tara: hey im sorry i have to call sid to discuss the homework
15/09/2021, 21:29 - Tara: i promise i'll be back soon
15/09/2021, 21:29 - Sandeepti Singh: no problem at all
15/09/2021, 22:51 - Sandeepti Singh: hey
15/09/2021, 22:51 - Sandeepti Singh: so i'm done
15/09/2021, 22:52 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think my code has some major logic errors
15/09/2021, 22:52 - Sandeepti Singh: here's my code

15/09/2021, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: my current code
15/09/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: is there any error you can find?
15/09/2021, 23:12 - Tara: Yeah so your red pin thing isn't working
15/09/2021, 23:13 - Tara: lmao my red pin is working and white isn't
15/09/2021, 23:13 - Sandeepti Singh: huh?
15/09/2021, 23:13 - Sandeepti Singh: i thought my red pin was fine
15/09/2021, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: could u show me? cuz so far i haven't noticed an error in it : (
15/09/2021, 23:15 - Tara: Ah I edited it but gimme a second I'll just remove it
15/09/2021, 23:17 - Tara: oh wait there's something wrong with the white pin
15/09/2021, 23:17 - Tara: red pin takes precedence
15/09/2021, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i think i treid to take care of that by this if (g3 == p0 || g3 == p1 || g3 == p2){
15/09/2021, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: like not comparing g3 == p3 for the white pins?
15/09/2021, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: doesn't that take care of?
15/09/2021, 23:19 - Tara: yeah it should
15/09/2021, 23:19 - Tara: I'm going to see why it doesn't work
15/09/2021, 23:24 - Tara: I think I fixed it
15/09/2021, 23:25 - Tara: ok first of all 
you need to add redpin = 0; before attemptNumber += 1
15/09/2021, 23:25 - Tara: And you know where you put whitepin -= 1;
15/09/2021, 23:25 - Tara: Change it to --whitepin;
15/09/2021, 23:26 - Tara: I think that was the issue?
15/09/2021, 23:26 - Tara: Remember how in the lecture she went over pre and post increments
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i put it at the beginning to reset at the end? why are they different
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Tara: ohh sorry
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i mean i think i put it at the beginning of the loop
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Tara: i missed that
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Tara: also 
is it not supposed to be > 12 instead of > 11
15/09/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: like everywhere?????
15/09/2021, 23:28 - Tara: I think so yes
15/09/2021, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: see that's what i put initially cuz it made sense but for some reason this way actually gives 12 attempts
15/09/2021, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: lol idk y
15/09/2021, 23:28 - Tara: The thing says "end of 12 turns"
15/09/2021, 23:28 - Tara: i assumed that meant 12
15/09/2021, 23:29 - Tara: oh
15/09/2021, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: yep. i assumed the same. but idk y this way gave 12 attempts
15/09/2021, 23:29 - Tara: well if it works then that's fine
15/09/2021, 23:29 - Tara: when is your lab
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: monday
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: y?
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Tara: no reason
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: so change whitepin-= 1 to --whitepin?
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Tara: yes
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Tara: if there's an issue
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i had nothing else to do today
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Tara: can we talk about it tomorrow please
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: yep yep no problem
15/09/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i did it early so i have time lol
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: ok you're coming a bit late tomorrow right
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: love it
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: also i hate myself
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: why did i send this
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: yep just a bit. 10ish minutes maybe
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: _why_ is it called passion
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Tara: the food isn't even that good
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: ture
15/09/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: the food is meh at best
15/09/2021, 23:32 - Tara: i like ebeneezers better
15/09/2021, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: wait quick q
15/09/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: do i put whitepin = -whitepin?
15/09/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh i can't remember the syntax
15/09/2021, 23:33 - Tara: no put --
15/09/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: so whitepin = -- whitepin
15/09/2021, 23:33 - Tara: -+ is the same as = x - 1
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: no no
literally just
--whitepin;
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Sandeepti Singh: hhaha okay sorry i'm dumb
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: -=*
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: it's fine
15/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: ok goodnight
15/09/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: good night
15/09/2021, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: oh my i think it works
15/09/2021, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: thansk so much
15/09/2021, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll try it a few more times tmr just to double check. i know you asleep but I realised I didn't even say thank you smh. i was legit in between workout haha
15/09/2021, 23:38 - Tara: Whoot whoot
15/09/2021, 23:38 - Tara: Psh it's fine
15/09/2021, 23:38 - Tara: Also when I say goodnight I mean I'm getting ready for bed and won't be sleeping in the next half hour
15/09/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: ahahah. same. i am gonna watch like an hour of tv and then go to sleep
15/09/2021, 23:40 - Tara: Gonna clean up my room because I have Chinese tutoring tomorrow and I can't be embarrassed
15/09/2021, 23:40 - Tara: She already knows too much about me
15/09/2021, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
15/09/2021, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: I legit never let my Chinese tutor come into my room
15/09/2021, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: We did it out in the hall
15/09/2021, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Tbh my roof is so impersonal
16/09/2021, 10:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro why is the math prof spending so long on proofs?
16/09/2021, 11:11 - Tara: """intuition"""
16/09/2021, 14:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Where r we meeting
16/09/2021, 14:54 - Tara: Printer right
16/09/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: heyyy
16/09/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: here's my code
16/09/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: sending it cuz it works for me but idk I just wanna double check lol
16/09/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
16/09/2021, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: btw before the mistake in my code was this: if C--> 6 3 1 6 and User typed in --> 6 3 1 1 then even though it should be R:3 and W:0, it was showing R:3 and W:1

16/09/2021, 21:32 - Tara: You can switch
16/09/2021, 21:32 - Tara: The TA said the tutorials don't really matter in the sense that there's no attendance taken
16/09/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH even siyoon was surprised? Why is that a little funny lol
16/09/2021, 21:33 - Tara: Yah we were walking back and she told me

Adapt when the conversation turns to something you're not particularly confident in
Make the answers more personal?
18/09/2021, 10:35 - Tara: The first point makes no sense one second
18/09/2021, 10:35 - Tara: Prepare your answers so you sound more confident or something

18/09/2021, 11:35 - Sandeepti Singh: here's my code btw
18/09/2021, 11:35 - Sandeepti Singh: like if you do end up playing it then tell me if you spot any error in the number of pins it shows
18/09/2021, 11:36 - Tara: Yep will do
18/09/2021, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: thanksssss
18/09/2021, 11:55 - Tara: <Media omitted>
18/09/2021, 11:56 - Sandeepti Singh: oh shit no that's the error
18/09/2021, 11:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i think that's my only error right now
18/09/2021, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: it's gonna count 4 twice for the whitepin
18/09/2021, 11:57 - Tara: good because the other cases work
18/09/2021, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah that's the one thing i need to resolve
18/09/2021, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: ughhhh

18/09/2021, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: so i'' get like 1 or 2 marks for this?
18/09/2021, 11:59 - Tara: 2 probably
18/09/2021, 11:59 - Tara: or 1.5
18/09/2021, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: ah shit
18/09/2021, 12:08 - Sandeepti Singh: do you have any suggestion how i can fix that

23/09/2021, 11:48 - Tara: Yeah sure
23/09/2021, 22:19 - Tara: Reading mythology and like
23/09/2021, 22:19 - Tara: Did Pasiphae really have sex with a wooden bull
23/09/2021, 22:19 - Tara: Poseidon, with the help of Aphrodite, made King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë, lust for the bull. Pasiphaë asked Daedalus to help her. Daedalus built a hollow, wooden cow, covered in real cow hide for Pasiphaë, so she could mate with the bull.
23/09/2021, 22:35 - Tara: Ohhh
23/09/2021, 22:35 - Tara: Ok so she was in the wooden bull
23/09/2021, 22:35 - Tara: And had sex with the white bill
23/09/2021, 22:35 - Tara: Bull
23/09/2021, 22:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but she got pregnant
23/09/2021, 22:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Which meant the bull ummmm penetrated her????
23/09/2021, 22:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I stg these mythologies are just so wild
23/09/2021, 22:43 - Tara: Jesus yeah they're so hard core
23/09/2021, 22:43 - Tara: I'm 33% done with Circe
24/09/2021, 17:45 - Sandeepti Singh: U coming???
24/09/2021, 17:45 - Tara: I have abandoned you /s
24/09/2021, 17:46 - Tara: I'm nearly at LSK
24/09/2021, 17:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
25/09/2021, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Too
25/09/2021, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Yo
25/09/2021, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Hello I mean
25/09/2021, 23:33 - Tara: Hi
25/09/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought I solved this physics question but I’m getting something wrong
25/09/2021, 23:34 - Sandeepti Singh: U remember enough about it to double check lol?
25/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: Sure but you gotta send the question number too
25/09/2021, 23:34 - Tara: Like the textbook one
25/09/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh okay lemme see
25/09/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
25/09/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I tried solving the first one and was so happy cuz I thought I understood it
25/09/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: And then got it wrong smh
25/09/2021, 23:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Physics is breaking me mind, body and soul
25/09/2021, 23:36 - Tara: Mood
25/09/2021, 23:41 - Tara: 1 and 3 are 0
25/09/2021, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep that’s what I think too
25/09/2021, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: But I think the tricky bit is that here the elec field is not 0
25/09/2021, 23:42 - Tara: 6 is 0 since the E field in the x direction is -5x but X=0
25/09/2021, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Not unifor I mean
25/09/2021, 23:43 - Tara: 4 is 0 too
25/09/2021, 23:43 - Tara: 5
-5 * x = -5 * 0.31
25/09/2021, 23:44 - Tara: Side 2?
2.72*0.31
25/09/2021, 23:44 - Tara: Huh
25/09/2021, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Side 5 the elec field is in -x direction
25/09/2021, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s the opposite of the area vector
25/09/2021, 23:45 - Tara: Wait it's +x
25/09/2021, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: So I thought it would -5 * 0.31^2
25/09/2021, 23:47 - Tara: Why ^2?
25/09/2021, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Area vector? So L squared right
25/09/2021, 23:47 - Tara: dL isn't ^2 right
25/09/2021, 23:48 - Tara: Ah shit isn't it ^3 because
25/09/2021, 23:49 - Tara: (-5L)*L^2
25/09/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh yea
25/09/2021, 23:49 - Tara: <Media omitted>
25/09/2021, 23:50 - Tara: And same thing for 2 except it's +3
25/09/2021, 23:50 - Tara: And then flux would be the sum of the |S|
25/09/2021, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
25/09/2021, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Like the thing I wrote at the end?

25/09/2021, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yay thanks got that one
25/09/2021, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: For the other question I legit have no clue how to do it
25/09/2021, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Also my friend mentioned a Bollywood night? Have u heard about it yet?
25/09/2021, 23:59 - Tara: Hmu

26/09/2021, 00:04 - Sandeepti Singh: I gave him the answer for comp code for last lab and helped him out with mastering physics 2 qs last time
26/09/2021, 00:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/09/2021, 00:05 - Tara: F=V* something

26/09/2021, 00:06 - Tara: If I were there I would bonk you
Time to not be that nice
26/09/2021, 00:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh yea but I thought we were both gonna be nice to each other
26/09/2021, 00:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Apparently not
26/09/2021, 00:07 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/09/2021, 00:08 - Tara: Back to your question
26/09/2021, 00:08 - Tara: How do we put in π
26/09/2021, 00:10 - Tara: What if we use A
26/09/2021, 00:10 - Tara: What's that formula with q and epsilon
26/09/2021, 00:10 - Tara: Well shit I've forgotten everything
26/09/2021, 00:10 - Tara: But I will help
26/09/2021, 00:11 - Tara: E =Q/(A*epsilon)
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Tara: And F=Eq
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Tara: This makes no sense
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: I legit have the same equation writttwm down lol
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Like from when I tried to solve them
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Tara: Oh my
26/09/2021, 00:12 - Tara: We both dumb
26/09/2021, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: But u already took the course so you’re fine
26/09/2021, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: How did u survive this omg
26/09/2021, 00:13 - Tara: It was the worst summer of my life
26/09/2021, 00:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh I feel u
26/09/2021, 00:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Everyday this course makes me believe more and more in Hinduism philosophy that this really is the hell
26/09/2021, 00:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Too dramatic?
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Tara: Absolutely not
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Tara: Night just convert back to Hinduism
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Tara: Like /g
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay we may have judged Vinayak too harsh
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Tara: Might*
26/09/2021, 00:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Boi came through with the answers

26/09/2021, 00:18 - Tara: I'm gonna read comics now
26/09/2021, 00:18 - Tara: And then the entirety of Percy Jackson

26/09/2021, 00:18 - Tara: Asterix / Tintin
26/09/2021, 00:19 - Tara: All my childhood books will be reread
26/09/2021, 00:25 - Tara: I dunno if I told you but my dad collected most of the comics but some were stolen so I basically bought the rest of them over the years
26/09/2021, 00:25 - Tara: Basically whenever we went to India I would buy a bunch of comics
26/09/2021, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea you never mentioned
26/09/2021, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Any particular reason lol
26/09/2021, 00:26 - Tara: Nope
26/09/2021, 00:26 - Tara: Nostalgia I guess
26/09/2021, 00:26 - Tara: Anyway were the answers right
26/09/2021, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz if I started rerreading my childhood books it will largely include dork diaries and Princess diaries
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep just put them in
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: Gah dork diaries
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Got 99.5% on my assignment dammit
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: Wait as in diary of a wimpy kid?
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: I hated that series
Greg was such a prick
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: No. They are literally called dork diaries
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: Oh damn must have forgotten
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: Have you read the mysterious benedict society
26/09/2021, 00:27 - Tara: I love that series
I only just realised there's a third and fourth book
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh never even heard of it
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Tara: Omg what
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk why but I’m just not in my book reading phase which is disappointing
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Tara: Ok now that was a good series
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I wanna read so many books
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: But can’t cuz my brain refuses to focus
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Tara: I am overwhelmed with books to read
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Same
26/09/2021, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Yet I can’t get myself to read
26/09/2021, 00:29 - Tara: Putting all that energy into studying? /s
26/09/2021, 00:30 - Tara: I miss my childhood self because that girl could _read_
26/09/2021, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol nah
26/09/2021, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea bro
26/09/2021, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: But I have legit replaced one escapist method (reading) for another (tv shows)
26/09/2021, 00:34 - Tara: Hahaha
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Tara: I think mine is either just talking to people or working
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Tara: I am but a social butterfly
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahahab
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Tara: Unless it's with aunties
In that case I will not talk to them
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Tara: Or their kids
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I’m getting more and more introverted bro
26/09/2021, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Like my social battery is draining out much quicker
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Tara: Fair enough
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Tara: Not a bad thing though
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: I went out with Prisha today and then came home after not spending that long with her and I could tell she was disappointed but I just didn’t have it in me to hang out more
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: It wasn’t like that on Friday though for some reason
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: I think it’s just the weekends lol
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Tara: I was just gonna say
Some people be exhausting
26/09/2021, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Like Hansika texted me if u wanted to hang out today
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: If i***
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Tara: Not talking about Prisha though
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: And again I just didn’t have it in me
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Bahahah shhh I won’t tell her
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Tara: Exhausting people include
Family
Classmates
26/09/2021, 00:38 - Tara: Everyone else is ok I think
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: For now
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I think it just depends on my mood
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: Some are on thin fuckin ice
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Classmates? Am I a classmate?
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: /s
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: No
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: Classmate as in classmate acquaintance
26/09/2021, 00:39 - Tara: Nah honestly scrap that
Family is exhausting
26/09/2021, 00:40 - Tara: Classmates are ok
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Yayyy I’m okay
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg bro yes
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Tara: Hmm ok last thing
It depends on the subject topic 
For example
For a while I thought Sid was exhausting because he kept going on about Odett and we were like bro get it together
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Again the only reason I survive is cuz my bro and I heavily judge and gossip
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lord do my random crushes drain u
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Tara: No
26/09/2021, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I can stop peppering them in lol
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Tara: I don't think you get how annoying it became
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Tara: Literally every night he would ask the same thing
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Tara: That frequent
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Ask?
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Like ask u guys soemthing
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Tara: Like whether he should go for it
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhhh
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Sandeepti Singh: I kinda get that
26/09/2021, 00:42 - Tara: In the end I told him to stop asking us and figure it out (paraphrased)
26/09/2021, 00:43 - Tara: Because we were out of fresh opinions
26/09/2021, 00:43 - Sandeepti Singh: As in get how annoying it can be lol
26/09/2021, 00:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea bro there’s only so many ways you can answer that question
26/09/2021, 00:44 - Tara: Eggjactly
26/09/2021, 00:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh like after i said no to efje? (But ig she was never into me lol but Idc) anytime we would text or meet or anything she would bring up kouta and go on about how hot he is
26/09/2021, 00:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Like on and on
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Sandeepti Singh: A) I didn’t find him that attractive but I can’t negate cuz that’s just rude
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Tara: Pls don't
It's my daily source of amusement
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Sandeepti Singh: B) like I get u wanna show me how fine you are but I don’t care
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Tara: Entertainment*
That was the word lmao I forgot
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Tara: Same thing
26/09/2021, 00:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I have another one but this one is truly a disappointing one that I need a bonk for and wanna get rid of
26/09/2021, 00:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Another pre-crush
26/09/2021, 00:46 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/09/2021, 00:46 - Tara: Spill
26/09/2021, 00:46 - Tara: Ok one second
26/09/2021, 00:46 - Tara: Gross
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: I suppose he is attractive
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: However
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: Ahxkajx
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: No
No romance
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: Only friendship
26/09/2021, 00:47 - Tara: Bonk to both of you
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Is it just me who doesn’t find him attractive lol?
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Like ofc he isn’t bad looking
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Ig he’s just not my type
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Tara: Yeah maybe
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: No.
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Like it’s truly bad
26/09/2021, 00:48 - Tara: Aw ok
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Tara: I promise not to judge you a much as I would normally
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Tara: If you ever tell me
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: No point dwelling on it cuz I just wanna erase this one from my mid
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Mind
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Like it’s that bad
26/09/2021, 00:49 - Tara: Yes good idea
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Keep in mind the last one was that white TA HAHAHAH
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: SO THIS IS WORSE
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: SO IMAGINE HOW BAD
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: BUT I AM FICKLE AND HOPEFULLY I MOVE ON
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Tara: Oh boy oh boy
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Tara: One question though
26/09/2021, 00:50 - Tara: Boy or girl
26/09/2021, 00:51 - Tara: I won't ask further questions
26/09/2021, 00:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Girl
26/09/2021, 00:51 - Tara: Ok
26/09/2021, 00:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is why it’s bad lol
26/09/2021, 00:51 - Tara: Moving on

26/09/2021, 00:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I have never been into a straight girl before. Like ever
26/09/2021, 00:52 - Tara: Truly tragic

26/09/2021, 00:54 - Tara: You are a sucker for the little things from near strangers
26/09/2021, 00:54 - Tara: This is so funny
She has two admirers 
And she's only met them twice
26/09/2021, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh fucking romance novels that have ruined my perception of reality
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Tara: On Thursday we will be dissecting her personality
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Tara: Well I will be
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: To be fair I don’t have a crush on her it’s just an annoying degree of like attractive ness to her
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Tara: Idk about you guys
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Tara: Same with Sid lah
26/09/2021, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Nah I don’t wanna. I just wanna move on

26/09/2021, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Satan
26/09/2021, 00:56 - Tara: Like she seems to fall easily too
26/09/2021, 00:56 - Tara: So

26/09/2021, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah

26/09/2021, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Let’s just find me a new crush
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Tara: Who do I bet against
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: That should be the focus
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Tara: Hansika would be an obvious choice
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Tara: Since we're both outsiders
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Tara: I'll bet against myself
26/09/2021, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea but pls let’s not tell Hansika lol
26/09/2021, 00:58 - Tara: Yes ma'am

26/09/2021, 00:58 - Tara: I will be observing you four
26/09/2021, 00:58 - Tara: So I can make fun of you later
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Tara: Y'all*
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Ughhh okay
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Tara: Not just you
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Tara: Plans are cooking
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: But do keep in mind that I legit never get flustered even when I’m talking to someone I might be into
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Or find attractive
26/09/2021, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I talked to her the way back
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Not a single stutter or anything
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Tara: You were pretty flustered when you realised she remembered your nsme
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: So it might not be that entertaining to watch me
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha no I don’t think I was
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Tara: Yeah unfortunately you and Sid have really good poker faces
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Like it was a normal amount of surprise
26/09/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Nothing too out of the ordinary
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Tara: I think I just have really high standards lmao because I sorta expected her not to forget your name
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol no I knew Sid was into sharna and I saw them talk for like 5 min
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Tara: Damn girl how
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Tara: Maybe I'm just terrible at reading people
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Tara: Yeah that might be it
26/09/2021, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: No see someone remembering my name is a normal thing rhat shouldn’t be a big deal
26/09/2021, 01:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha whatever knowing me I’ll be over it by like tmr
26/09/2021, 01:02 - Tara: Pls tell me if this is the case because I had a plan
26/09/2021, 01:02 - Tara: And I now gotta change it
26/09/2021, 01:02 - Tara: If that's the case
26/09/2021, 01:02 - Sandeepti Singh: What was the plan?
26/09/2021, 01:03 - Tara: It's very insignificant
26/09/2021, 01:03 - Tara: And now that I think about it
Very weird
26/09/2021, 01:03 - Tara: Ok good
The plan is off
26/09/2021, 01:03 - Tara: I was gonna get her to remember your surname
26/09/2021, 01:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh yep that is weird
26/09/2021, 01:04 - Tara: Weird only because you haven't told her your surname
26/09/2021, 01:04 - Sandeepti Singh: She’s nice and all but I’m honestly not gonna get hung up on it or anything.
26/09/2021, 01:04 - Tara: Other than that

28/09/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: So at this point it’s not scary it’s just annoying lol
28/09/2021, 12:08 - Tara: Welp my mom still terrifies me
28/09/2021, 12:09 - Tara: Also wish me luck gonna get lunch with Vinayak probably
28/09/2021, 12:09 - Tara: This will be awkward
28/09/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: No lah it will be fine
28/09/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Bust out those dazzling stories
28/09/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao borrow mine if u want
28/09/2021, 12:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Imagine u telling a story like “omg I was drinking out with friends and we got like so totally drunk and then three of us started making out together and like while this was happening I suddenly pulled back and started teaching them integration for a few seconds and then we went back to kissing. Like omg it was so totally hilarious”
28/09/2021, 12:13 - Sandeepti Singh: That how I speak in my mind lmao
28/09/2021, 12:32 - Tara: What
28/09/2021, 12:33 - Tara: Ok turns out we know the same dude
28/09/2021, 12:33 - Tara: Rishibh
28/09/2021, 12:36 - Tara: The Cambridge dude
28/09/2021, 12:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Appropriate response ig?
28/09/2021, 12:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh I think Vinayak did mention him
28/09/2021, 14:02 - Tara: UST secrets has a lot of posts about Disha's group
Are they just sending posts about themselves
28/09/2021, 14:11 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s what I think is happening
28/09/2021, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Also remember vanshika mentioned that when they get drunk they apparently brag about sending in the post themselves
28/09/2021, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: like I genuinely think there aren’t enough people on campus who’d care enough to post about how great a group is or how hot a person is??? Like that’s just weird
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Tara: i know right
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Tara: like they're well known
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Tara: but there are 8k undergraduates
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Tara: and no one else is mentioned by name
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea exactly
28/09/2021, 14:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol what brought about this random gossip thing?
28/09/2021, 14:14 - Tara: vinayak mentioned that something happened in the lc
28/09/2021, 14:14 - Tara: so i followed the secrets page

28/09/2021, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: It was weird
28/09/2021, 16:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Also how was lunch with them?
28/09/2021, 16:37 - Tara: Yes
28/09/2021, 16:37 - Tara: I was being productive
28/09/2021, 16:37 - Tara: Well it was just Vinayak
28/09/2021, 16:37 - Tara: And it was alright
28/09/2021, 16:38 - Tara: I found out his dad works at the embassy and that's how he knows Rishibh
28/09/2021, 16:39 - Tara: I don't like a lot of the posts
People be racist
28/09/2021, 16:40 - Tara: And high-key misogynistic
28/09/2021, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea the racism and misogyny on that page is infuriating
28/09/2021, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: And the occasional transphobia
28/09/2021, 19:54 - Tara: Did you tell Vinayak that Sid likes Siyoon
28/09/2021, 19:54 - Tara: He better not bring it up smh but he doesn't seem like the type of person to do so
28/09/2021, 19:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm i think I by mistake implied it when we were talking about how y’all had dinner with siyoon
28/09/2021, 19:57 - Tara: Ah
I dunno why I asked because I also told you two before Sid did
28/09/2021, 19:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea but I think my part was a little bad cuz Vinayak is new but then again Sid prefers Vinayak over me lol
28/09/2021, 19:58 - Tara: I have no comment
28/09/2021, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao okay
28/09/2021, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: I think my statement was factually correct
28/09/2021, 19:58 - Tara: I think so?
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: But yea I don’t think Vinayak is the kinda guy who’ll blab
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Tara: I dunno man
They nerd out together
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Tara: Eh don't concern yourself with that
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol don’t tell sid but if I had to rank people he is absolutely the person I’d put last lol
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: I
28/09/2021, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: I kinda forgot that I implied it tbh
28/09/2021, 20:00 - Tara: Pls it's fine

28/09/2021, 20:04 - Tara: Like /g
28/09/2021, 20:04 - Tara: I'm not to be trusted with money
28/09/2021, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: We know
28/09/2021, 20:05 - Tara: If it were up to me I would buy all cool shit then donate the rest of my money to the Malala fund
28/09/2021, 20:05 - Tara: Then go off the grid
28/09/2021, 20:05 - Tara: Why am I telling you my escape plan
28/09/2021, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: HAhaha
28/09/2021, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: My escape plan probs involves me falling in love with a anti-hero and then running away together
28/09/2021, 20:06 - Tara: I'll be that hermit with a fucking Segway
28/09/2021, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Smh I am a hopeless romantic can u cure that?
28/09/2021, 20:06 - Tara: That is also a mood
28/09/2021, 20:06 - Tara: No I think you just need to fall in Love
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha easier said than done bro
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Tara: And then realise that love is a nonexistent concept enforced by society to make Babies or something
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Never loved anyone. Only one I told “I love u” to is Simran and Prisha
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Not even my parents lol
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Tara: Wow
28/09/2021, 20:07 - Tara: Ok same though

28/09/2021, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: See rationally I do know that
28/09/2021, 20:08 - Sandeepti Singh: But ummm the entirety of human mind is a shit show lol
28/09/2021, 20:08 - Tara: It's very hard saying it to certain people
Like with most friends I can say it but not the rest of them
28/09/2021, 20:08 - Tara: The most I can do is "I appreciate your presence"
28/09/2021, 20:09 - Tara: And then there's the superficial i love you's

01/10/2021, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Question. Not related to studies
01/10/2021, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: U there 😶
01/10/2021, 20:25 - Tara: Ja
01/10/2021, 20:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Were u there for the convo with Sid at the party or something where I remarked (idk when but I am like 90% it was when we were talking about the pavlov’a conditioning thing)
01/10/2021, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Sid was talking about how he doesn’t want me to fall in love with him????? I can’t remember but basically I think I said that sid basically like any attractive girl that he’s mildly friends with
01/10/2021, 20:28 - Tara: Oh yes
01/10/2021, 20:28 - Tara: I was very confused for a second because I thought you were talking about air conditioning
01/10/2021, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: And then I think he said something like well that’s not true I didn’t fall in love with u????
01/10/2021, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Did this happen???
01/10/2021, 20:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol cuz if it did that’s a very very very backhanded way of calling someone attractive???
01/10/2021, 20:29 - Tara: ngl i was not really part of that conversation
i just told efje about the tumblr post
01/10/2021, 20:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh damn 😑
01/10/2021, 20:30 - Tara: Ok hmm
01/10/2021, 20:30 - Tara: I think
01/10/2021, 20:30 - Tara: If he spent more time with you and you guys didn't roast each other that much
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Tara: There's a possibility he will fall for you
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Tara: I think
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Tara: He's really a hopeless romantic dude
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Why would u say that bro? No. Shhh. No
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: I guess I can’t stop roasting him then
01/10/2021, 20:31 - Tara: this is also true
01/10/2021, 20:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao same though
01/10/2021, 20:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea lol I just remember being ????? When he said that cuz I didn’t notice the deeply hidden (probably by mistake) compliment
01/10/2021, 20:32 - Tara: Also we were getting dinner and Sid said he thinks Vinayak likes someone
01/10/2021, 20:33 - Tara: But I do not see it

01/10/2021, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: They simplified it to arrays
01/10/2021, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll show it to u later… it seems interesting for smart people
01/10/2021, 22:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh quick q for comp will they test memory stuff like joe many bits in double/ float etc or what the values of their ranges are?
01/10/2021, 22:09 - Tara: ya i think so

01/10/2021, 23:38 - Tara: How could you
01/10/2021, 23:39 - Tara: She cannot know about this because then she'll assume we're creepy
01/10/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
01/10/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: My lips are sealed
01/10/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro I keep introducing people who then become really good friends. My fatal flaw
01/10/2021, 23:43 - Tara: You have very good taste in friend s
01/10/2021, 23:43 - Tara: Case in point: me
01/10/2021, 23:48 - Tara: Bro have we like established a fandom

02/10/2021, 12:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahahha
02/10/2021, 12:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Shhh what are you taking about? What fandom?
02/10/2021, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: omg literally hate myself sometimes
02/10/2021, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: i saw this song in this spotify playlist called eiji's song
02/10/2021, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vha5Uyb65mU&ab_channel=Divs_nj
02/10/2021, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: i am crying again. Why must i do this to myself???
02/10/2021, 13:58 - Tara: Get it together
He's just a functional character
02/10/2021, 13:58 - Tara: Fictional
02/10/2021, 14:00 - Sandeepti Singh: I know
02/10/2021, 14:00 - Sandeepti Singh: But also ;(
02/10/2021, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Sorry to disappoint
02/10/2021, 21:16 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
02/10/2021, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I thought it would be a is false so the first part of the ternary operation is true so the answer would be 1
02/10/2021, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: What am I missing?
02/10/2021, 21:31 - Tara: Hmm I think it's because 0 is always false
02/10/2021, 21:31 - Tara: it goes to the 'else' statement
02/10/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh I see
02/10/2021, 21:32 - Tara: Are you sure because I don't really get it either
02/10/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought that false = false will be true?
02/10/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’ll be 1
02/10/2021, 21:33 - Tara: Yeah I thought that too
02/10/2021, 21:33 - Tara: Oh lord I made the mistake of asking Sid for help
He's terrible at explaining stuff over text
02/10/2021, 21:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lol
02/10/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Tell me if you understand
02/10/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz the answer is that it’ll always be false
02/10/2021, 21:34 - Tara: Yes I get it now
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: well firstly false
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: will return the inner condition right
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: like false anything is false
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: like false ? x: y
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: returns y
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: then true ? x:y returns x
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: ya
02/10/2021, 21:35 - Tara: oh hey i have access to the comp2011 page
02/10/2021, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Did they change the questions from when u did it?
02/10/2021, 21:36 - Tara: Nope
02/10/2021, 21:36 - Tara: Oh my I think I asked the same question to Sid last year
02/10/2021, 21:36 - Tara: I clearly did not learn
02/10/2021, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahahaha
02/10/2021, 21:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey take solace in the fact that ur done with the course
02/10/2021, 21:37 - Tara: <Media omitted>
02/10/2021, 21:37 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t understand how I’m supposed to work on lab and assignment at the same time?
02/10/2021, 21:37 - Tara: yes i will never touch c++ again
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhhhh
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually that helps a lot
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Tara: your assignment makes no sense to me
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I am always a bit unsure about ternary so I’ll try to convert it to if else statements
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Same girl
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: I have no idea what the assignment means
02/10/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: I am dying
02/10/2021, 21:39 - Tara: are you allowed to define new arrays
02/10/2021, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Dunno
02/10/2021, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: I will start working on it Friday
02/10/2021, 21:39 - Tara: ok
02/10/2021, 21:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I wanna finish midterm and the new physics chapter before I move onto the comp assignment
02/10/2021, 21:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh btw are we having lunch with Yuen yin
02/10/2021, 21:40 - Tara: 1230 tuesday

02/10/2021, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha okay
02/10/2021, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Is it the khushi delivery thing
02/10/2021, 21:44 - Tara: Oh god no I'm not a traitor /s

06/10/2021, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
06/10/2021, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Is even and therefor mod is 0 I mean
06/10/2021, 14:58 - Tara: if ((i + j) % 2) basically means if ((i + j) % 2 == 1)
06/10/2021, 14:58 - Tara: so it would just print 2
06/10/2021, 14:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Why won’t it print when i and j are both 0
06/10/2021, 14:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz0%2 is 0 so wouldn’t her break statement not be executed
06/10/2021, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh cheeee

06/10/2021, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: J< I smh
06/10/2021, 15:01 - Tara: yeah 0 + 0 is not an option i think
06/10/2021, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep yep I didn’t notice that j had to be less than I

06/10/2021, 21:02 - Tara: She be cracking

06/10/2021, 22:06 - Tara: I don't think they release labs a week into the assignment

08/10/2021, 19:05 - Tara: I guess we don't
08/10/2021, 19:05 - Tara: Also I think if you look at the timing it would be more than 90 minutes?
08/10/2021, 19:05 - Tara: Lemme check
08/10/2021, 19:06 - Tara: Nvm it's 90 minutes in total

08/10/2021, 19:12 - Tara: So 7.5 hours in total
08/10/2021, 19:12 - Tara: Which is acceptable
08/10/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep. But not something that should be repeated
08/10/2021, 19:13 - Tara: Yeah no
08/10/2021, 19:13 - Tara: It was weird
08/10/2021, 19:13 - Tara: I'm pretty sure I messed up my emails

08/10/2021, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also why did the tutorial slide say we needed to do it in 1.5 hours ahhhh
08/10/2021, 19:15 - Tara: Dude I'm scared
My organisation 📉
08/10/2021, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Making us stressed for no good reason
08/10/2021, 19:15 - Tara: Even notifications like oh your thing has been marked?
08/10/2021, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep. Will not delete
08/10/2021, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Just in case
08/10/2021, 19:16 - Tara: 🤦‍♀️
08/10/2021, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Last but not least I wasn’t rude once to aid

08/10/2021, 19:19 - Tara: Go buy yourself ice cream or something
08/10/2021, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Me moving is not a treat
08/10/2021, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll just take an extra hour of break
08/10/2021, 19:20 - Tara: Order ice-cream
08/10/2021, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: (Like I wasn’t gonna do that anyways hahah)
08/10/2021, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro how u gonna fall asleep though now?
08/10/2021, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: When I sleep in the afternoon it takes me ages to fall asleep in the night
08/10/2021, 19:26 - Tara: I'm still tired
08/10/2021, 19:28 - Tara: Napping in the afternoon doesn't affect me trying to sleep at night
08/10/2021, 19:28 - Tara: Tbh it takes me a long time to sleep anyway when I'm home
08/10/2021, 20:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh it takes me forever to fall asleep
08/10/2021, 20:55 - Sandeepti Singh: 1 hours minimum
08/10/2021, 20:55 - Tara: Same
08/10/2021, 20:55 - Tara: I simply have too many thoughts
08/10/2021, 20:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yep
08/10/2021, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: My brain is just as talkative as me
08/10/2021, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol
08/10/2021, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey
08/10/2021, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: You got a minute
08/10/2021, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
08/10/2021, 23:38 - Tara: Oui
08/10/2021, 23:39 - Tara: Sorry for the late reply
I was watching black mirror
08/10/2021, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: No problem
08/10/2021, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s a math question though
08/10/2021, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: And it’s kinda late and u should be asleep
08/10/2021, 23:48 - Tara: Hmu
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Been doing that for like 45 min
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Tara: Oh boy I love these questions
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Tara: I forgot how to do them though so gimme like ten minutes
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah no
08/10/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: I mean np
08/10/2021, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Not a rude no lol
08/10/2021, 23:50 - Tara: <Media omitted>
08/10/2021, 23:52 - Tara: <X,y> = a*v1+b*v2
Or
-3 -2 * a = x
-4 -3    b    y
08/10/2021, 23:52 - Tara: I can't draw the brakxets but you know what I mean right
08/10/2021, 23:52 - Tara: So then you solve for a and b
08/10/2021, 23:54 - Tara: -3 -3 
4 2
a = -3x-3y
b = 4x+2y
08/10/2021, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
08/10/2021, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: But then idk what calculation to do
08/10/2021, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I keep getting the answer wrong
08/10/2021, 23:56 - Tara: T[x
   y] =
T((-3x-3y)v1+(4x+2y)v2)
= (-3x-3y)T(v1) + ...
= (-3x-3y)*<49,-10> +...
08/10/2021, 23:57 - Tara: Lemme write it out proper
08/10/2021, 23:57 - Tara: Ly
08/10/2021, 23:57 - Tara: This is confusing
08/10/2021, 23:59 - Tara: <Media omitted>
09/10/2021, 00:00 - Tara: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1835230/finding-the-image-of-an-arbitrary-vector
09/10/2021, 00:00 - Tara: Stack overflow is dead helpful for maths questions
09/10/2021, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: I legit followed that same stack overflow thing
09/10/2021, 00:00 - Tara: They're not as condescending as the ones in the programming one

09/10/2021, 00:03 - Tara: I got a weird vector
09/10/2021, 00:03 - Tara: Oh

09/10/2021, 00:10 - Tara: You didn't take the negative of b and c
09/10/2021, 00:10 - Sandeepti Singh: I did they’re both negative to begin with so they became positive right
09/10/2021, 00:11 - Tara: Oh yes sorry I missed that

When you write the equation for loop 2 you would use -I1?

20/10/2021, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I1 for loop 1 would be negative
20/10/2021, 16:26 - Tara: Oh really

21/10/2021, 22:16 - Tara: oui good idea

22/10/2021, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao first off if we take it out of context without reading ur messages then it sounds so wrong
22/10/2021, 01:08 - Tara: Well thank God for receipts
22/10/2021, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Second off not really a compliment cuz it’s cuz he “has no interest in talking to me”
22/10/2021, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: But eh dim

22/10/2021, 01:09 - Tara: Sid kinda just says things without thinking them through
22/10/2021, 01:09 - Tara: I don't think he doesn't has any interest in talking to you
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha it’s okay bro I rarely get mad at stuff anyone says u don’t have to like justify
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s okay
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh remember when I said I would start studying at 11
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Tara: Also Sid and I usually work well together because we don't talk either while studying
It's just that when there are more than three people it goes to shit
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Started at 12:30 🤡
22/10/2021, 01:10 - Tara: At least you started
22/10/2021, 01:11 - Tara: I decided to rewatch killing eve

22/10/2021, 01:12 - Tara: How
22/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: For you it's less concerning because you watch a lot of shows
22/10/2021, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I remember the gist but if I rewatch there’ll always be story lines that are like huhhhh that happened?
22/10/2021, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks?
22/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: Dammit I'm writing really slowly because I'm swiping the keyboard with one have

22/10/2021, 01:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Grape
22/10/2021, 01:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I feel like giving or throwing a grape at someone was like marrying someone in Greek mythology or did I make that up
22/10/2021, 01:19 - Tara: Oh
22/10/2021, 01:19 - Tara: I'll give you a shriveled grape

22/10/2021, 12:07 - Tara: Ohh

22/10/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Do u know why?
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Tara: Oo
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I forgot to put return 0 in one of the functions
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Doesn’t impact the program
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: But zinc will say it’s wrong
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Tara: Bro what the hell
22/10/2021, 12:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanna cry so bad
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Tara: Hey
Do not cry
It's just 10%
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Sandeepti Singh: This is like comp1021 me adding spaces and getting two questions wrong all over again
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Tara: You'll get higher than the mean in the other assignments
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but below mean is like C
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Tara: And you got +1sd in the quiz right
22/10/2021, 12:08 - Sandeepti Singh: I worked so hard for the quiz and it’s all nullified though
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea but I guess the average would be like slight above mean
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Tara: What why
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz like I did okay on quiz but so bad on assignment so it cancels out
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I know I’m being Irrational
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Tara: Bro stfu
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Tara: Yes you are
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: And I know why that doesn’t make sense
22/10/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: But right now I just wanna be sad

26/10/2021, 17:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>

26/10/2021, 17:31 - Tara: <Media omitted>

28/10/2021, 00:04 - Tara: Sorry wrong person
28/10/2021, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahahah girl we are amazing at prediction
28/10/2021, 00:40 - Sandeepti Singh: This is a tad sad for Sid and efje (cuz idk if siyoon is fruity) but hmm I love that we just knew it even before they met each other that efje might be into siyoon
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Tara: She's fruity(?)
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Tara: Lmao
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Tara: It is sad
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Tara: But also so damn funny
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Tara: Like this is some sitcom level shit
28/10/2021, 01:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Like not entirely straight
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Fruity == some form of queer but nicer to say lmao
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh thank god it’s not just me thinking it’s funny
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Tara: Oh I just thought you misspelt LGBT
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Let’s low-key watch the world burn  hahah
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Tara: Bro you briefly liking her was incredibly funny too
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha no
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: We don’t talk about that
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Tara: Cool
28/10/2021, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: It wasn’t liking
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: Well on Monday we're gonna find out
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: Efje is gonna ask on Saturday
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: I on Monday
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: She's gonna think we like her gosh
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: But I'm ok with that because I don't
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 01:04 - Tara: Oh no if she's lgbt
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh damnnn that’s also interesting
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought she was straight up gonna ask her out lmao
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Tara: Haha as if
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Tara: We just had a conversation where Sid (again) was like hmm should I ask her out
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Tara: I don't remember what we concluded though
28/10/2021, 01:05 - Tara: So I'm just gonna wait for him to say something
28/10/2021, 01:06 - Tara: His arguments we're terrible
28/10/2021, 01:06 - Tara: Were
28/10/2021, 01:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh again
28/10/2021, 01:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I can usually tell if people are into other people
28/10/2021, 01:06 - Sandeepti Singh: But I haven’t really seen them interact so idk
28/10/2021, 01:07 - Sandeepti Singh: But ummmmmm don’t tell sid I said this but she may be a teeny tiny bit out of his league but idk anything could happen????
28/10/2021, 01:07 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 01:07 - Tara: Example
28/10/2021, 01:08 - Tara: Eh that's fine
28/10/2021, 01:08 - Tara: Now that our circles are tighter I can tell
28/10/2021, 01:08 - Tara: If this was high school I would not have a clue
28/10/2021, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh bro I didn’t know he was that serious when it came to pining
28/10/2021, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooof
28/10/2021, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s tragic
28/10/2021, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh so can u tell if siyoon’s into him?
28/10/2021, 01:09 - Tara: He's _serious_
I don't even remember studying for finals
I just know that we had very long and exhausting conversations about Odett
28/10/2021, 01:10 - Tara: I honestly don't think she is
28/10/2021, 01:10 - Tara: If I had to ship her with anyone it would be Efje
28/10/2021, 01:11 - Tara: Based off chemistry
28/10/2021, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm same tbh
28/10/2021, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: But also I have legit never spent time with her so I don’t know her well enough to make the assessment
28/10/2021, 01:12 - Tara: True
28/10/2021, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: But I’m selfish and don’t want him to ask her out cuz it’ll mess up the group dynamic but also if it helps him get over her then that’s a good thing?
28/10/2021, 01:12 - Tara: Omg I didn't think about that
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: Hhhhhh
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: We can't lose her as a friend
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: If she takes it badly
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: But realistically what do you think
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Tara: Would she break up with us
28/10/2021, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm it really depends. She’s new and I think most of us are more used to did
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Sid
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Sandeepti Singh: So she might distance
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Tara: You and I are the puppet masters here
We must influence this for our benefit
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Tara: Aw
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Tara: This is why we're both 10+% dark
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Sandeepti Singh: But also it’s also totally possible that she doesn’t distant
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Wait I am too tired now
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Tara: Ugh so annoying
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Can we talk about this later
28/10/2021, 01:14 - Tara: Yes okay we'll talk later
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Sandeepti Singh: This is so interesting but also tied
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Tara: My eyes are tired as well
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Also one of my nails broke completely
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Tara: Oh no
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Like my index finger on the right hand
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Tara: Are you gonna remove the other ones too
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Not yet
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Sandeepti Singh: It looks weird lol
28/10/2021, 01:15 - Tara: Snip snip
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay bye now
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Ttyl
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Tara: Goodnight
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Tara: Wait a second
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: The puppet masters shall convene once again
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Tara: You're not coming tomorrow right
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Nope
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Tara: Because I have no plans to leave my room
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Too much to study
28/10/2021, 01:16 - Tara: Yuen Yin is home too
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh we can all meet up to study on Friday
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: I finally got a glimpse of her inner self btw
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Kinda like last time
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: Like a very brief one
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooooh interested
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Tell me on Friday

28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: Okay
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Imma go now
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: We'll slowly chip at her
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: Until we know everything
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: Well I will
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Tara: Yes goodnight
28/10/2021, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Ofc so will I
28/10/2021, 01:18 - Sandeepti Singh: We sound like psychos
28/10/2021, 01:18 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/10/2021, 01:24 - Tara: If anyone sees our texts we'd be absolutely cancelled and in a mental hospital
28/10/2021, 03:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
28/10/2021, 03:09 - Sandeepti Singh: But also ma’am why do I keep doing this? By this I mean saying good night then deciding to read “a little bit”
28/10/2021, 03:09 - Sandeepti Singh: And it suddenly being like 2 hours later
28/10/2021, 03:10 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s only 2 hours this time cuz I finished the whole book
28/10/2021, 03:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Cried so much man. I need to stop associating with fictional characters so much lol
28/10/2021, 10:23 - Tara: Hhhh what book did you read
28/10/2021, 10:23 - Tara: And why
28/10/2021, 10:29 - Sandeepti Singh: I finished this one called story of u and me and then proceeded to start and finish this one called shoulder to cry on
28/10/2021, 10:29 - Sandeepti Singh: They’re both comics though
28/10/2021, 10:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Like why did I read it or why did I cry?
28/10/2021, 10:30 - Tara: Why cry
28/10/2021, 10:30 - Tara: Ok actually both
28/10/2021, 10:30 - Sandeepti Singh: I read to relax for a bit. Huge mistake
28/10/2021, 10:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk bro ever since I read song of Achilles I cry so easily for books and shot
28/10/2021, 10:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Like not only will I cry when they sad but also when tjey happy hahah?
28/10/2021, 10:32 - Tara: Well at least you're in touch with your emotions
28/10/2021, 10:32 - Tara: Achilles really turned that tap on
28/10/2021, 10:32 - Tara: If you weren't before
28/10/2021, 10:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah only when it comes to fiction 🤡
28/10/2021, 10:32 - Sandeepti Singh: I think it did lol
28/10/2021, 10:33 - Tara: Ok yeah that's weird
28/10/2021, 10:33 - Tara: You don't cry about real things
28/10/2021, 10:33 - Tara: ?
28/10/2021, 10:35 - Tara: Hey does gerua mean orange
28/10/2021, 10:36 - Tara: Why is there a song that's just called orange
28/10/2021, 10:36 - Tara: That's bizarre
28/10/2021, 18:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk lemme ask my mum
28/10/2021, 18:38 - Sandeepti Singh: She has a masters in Hindi for some reason lol
28/10/2021, 18:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Super rare. Actually not true I might cry if I’m in a bad mood but not when it comes to other people idk?
28/10/2021, 18:39 - Sandeepti Singh: But still nowhere near compared to how easily I cry at fiction
28/10/2021, 18:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay so gerua does indeed mean orange but my mum says the song is referring to a devotion like with religious connotations cuz orange is the color that Hindu saints wear so it’s referring to a holy form of love/devotion
28/10/2021, 18:51 - Sandeepti Singh: So I guess a romantic love that’s so strong and pure that it rivals that or saints?
28/10/2021, 19:10 - Tara: Oh wow
That's interesting
28/10/2021, 19:10 - Tara: Oh okay that makes sense
Thanks a lot
28/10/2021, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah np

29/10/2021, 22:41 - Tara: She's gonna be sick of the entire group
29/10/2021, 22:41 - Tara: Oml if we have disagreements
She would be the perfect mediator
29/10/2021, 22:54 - Tara: Hey I have a question about elec

06/11/2021, 12:04 - Tara: And there wasn't enough time to type
06/11/2021, 12:04 - Sandeepti Singh: You know how they said the output from Schmitt trigger is 20%
06/11/2021, 12:04 - Tara: Was that the DC 👀
06/11/2021, 12:04 - Tara: Help

06/11/2021, 12:05 - Sandeepti Singh: But I ended up never using that???????????
06/11/2021, 12:05 - Tara: Welp
06/11/2021, 12:05 - Tara: Hopefully the coursework will pull our grade up
06/11/2021, 12:05 - Tara: We can get 90%+ on that
06/11/2021, 12:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Also for the KVL I DID IT THREE SEPARATE TIMES QNF GOT 3 fucking separate answers

06/11/2021, 12:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeahhh let’s make sure the robot is fine
06/11/2021, 12:06 - Tara: I'm gonna assume that Sid found it ok
06/11/2021, 12:06 - Tara: Else he would have complained
06/11/2021, 12:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah ofc he did

06/11/2021, 12:09 - Tara: I found like two questions hard in the mcw
06/11/2021, 12:09 - Tara: Including the h bridge one
06/11/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah no I wasn’t sure about 4/5 of them
06/11/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: And they were the multiple answers one
06/11/2021, 12:09 - Tara: Ouch
06/11/2021, 12:09 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s very unlikely I guessed them right

06/11/2021, 12:11 - Tara: Do we wait for you or just go your place straight
06/11/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Sid seemed mildly mad that I didn’t invite him  but u didn’t wanna invite a dude lol and idk y?
06/11/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Maybe come to my place straight cuz it’s too many people for me to pick up
06/11/2021, 12:11 - Tara: Make sense you were talking about it a lot
06/11/2021, 12:12 - Tara: Ugh there's a comma aftet sense

06/11/2021, 17:00 - Tara: Are you doing separate compilation
06/11/2021, 17:00 - Tara: If so I didn't make a makefile thing
06/11/2021, 17:00 - Tara: Because they gave no clear instructions
06/11/2021, 17:00 - Sandeepti Singh: compile mulitple files together
06/11/2021, 17:00 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz for assignment it takes like 5 commands every single time
06/11/2021, 17:03 - Tara: Yeah hmm I don't remember exactly what I did
06/11/2021, 17:03 - Sandeepti Singh: idk if i can go shopping tmr

06/11/2021, 22:56 - Tara: Hi yes ok
06/11/2021, 22:56 - Tara: Efje is not over Siyoon 🤦‍♀️
06/11/2021, 22:56 - Tara: If Sid was a simp she's worse
06/11/2021, 22:57 - Tara: And she knows it
06/11/2021, 22:57 - Tara: Sharing a seat 😭
06/11/2021, 22:57 - Sandeepti Singh: who's the hickey from on efje?
06/11/2021, 22:58 - Tara: Thursday night she met this girl Aisha and they made out
06/11/2021, 22:58 - Tara: Girl it was so weird
The next day Aisha asked if she wanted Starbucks so Efje asked if I wanted to come to?
06/11/2021, 22:58 - Tara: I still went though
For emotional support
06/11/2021, 22:58 - Tara: Anyway Aisha was very funny and I approve
06/11/2021, 22:59 - Tara: Also Siyoon is so goddamn good at dodging questions
Example for today
Closeted
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Tara: Maybe she's onto our games
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao like met at ust?
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: and then just randomly made ot hahha
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Tara: Yes
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Tara: That's really all I know from how they know each other
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Tara: I think she also mentioned bumble
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHAHA no way
06/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ooooh that makes sense
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: she does genuinely go out with people on bumble sometimes
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i have heard her mention it a couple of times
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Tara: Ya
She cancelled her Friday date too
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Tara: Which was sad because I made her buy a black jacket and combat boots
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Tara: She was supposed to buy a leather jacket but she went with denim
06/11/2021, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i think she's just clueless cuz she's just genuinely not that informed about this stuff

you may be trash but at least you're sparkly trash
14/11/2021, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Vignesh said he’ll put the stuff on good docs and send it again
14/11/2021, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Nah it’s the surroundings of the trash that sparkle (u✨)
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: ew
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: no
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: stop
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: being nice
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: i dislike this
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: i mean im blushing
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: but also no
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: how about i be nice and just add /s
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: no
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: so you have the option of assuming I'm just kidding
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: theres no hope
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Tara: simply do not compliment me
14/11/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: now that i know it annoys you....
14/11/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: i am so much more motivated to compliment you
14/11/2021, 23:24 - Tara: hhhh
14/11/2021, 23:24 - Tara: fine
14/11/2021, 23:24 - Tara: well i hope you like seeing me cringe
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Okie bye
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Tara: oui goodbye
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I just realised no elec == no us having study sessions on Monday
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Tara: sa
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Tara: d
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Tara: not like we got any studying done
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Tara: but sad
14/11/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahahah
14/11/2021, 23:43 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
14/11/2021, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: they have some stuff which i think we can incorporate into ours?
14/11/2021, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: like the delay in the beginning
14/11/2021, 23:46 - Tara: ya
14/11/2021, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: and put everything in the code in the else if statement so that the bumper sensor one to see if the car is at the start line is not triggered?
14/11/2021, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: also let's make our code have proper comments lol
14/11/2021, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: and maybe we could get an idea of the speeds from theirs?
14/11/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: does that make sense idk how to describe but we don't want the bumper sense to detect something until the very end?
14/11/2021, 23:49 - Tara: hmm yeah makes sense
14/11/2021, 23:49 - Tara: i will finish this chinese thing and look at it
14/11/2021, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: okay
15/11/2021, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh also   // initialize output pins
  // car stationary until white paper flashes
  digitalWrite(pinL_DIR, LOW);     //
  digitalWrite(pinR_DIR, LOW;      //
  analogWrite(pinL_PWM, 0);        //forward speed 
  analogWrite(pinR_PWM, 0);        //forward speed 
}
15/11/2021, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: in this part change it to high hihg
15/11/2021, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: because we want the wheels to be forward
15/11/2021, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: low means backward
15/11/2021, 00:01 - Tara: aight
15/11/2021, 00:44 - Sandeepti Singh: okay yea sid told vignesh i'm into someone else which ain't exactly a lie so it's good that he won't do anything anymore
15/11/2021, 01:20 - Tara: Ha Sid told him you're into an older guy
15/11/2021, 01:20 - Tara: Hahaha
15/11/2021, 01:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh why would he say that hahaha
15/11/2021, 01:21 - Tara: Idk to throw him off?
15/11/2021, 01:21 - Sandeepti Singh: I told him to not give any details smh
15/11/2021, 01:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/11/2021, 01:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh he did send me this
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Sandeepti Singh: I missed the older dude dammit
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Tara: It's not a disaster
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh if anything the person I’m currently most into is Max unfortunately
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Tara: He is older so
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Tara: Not exactly a lie?
15/11/2021, 01:22 - Sandeepti Singh: So the fact he went with older is funny hahah
15/11/2021, 01:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Like ig sid assumed I was into max
15/11/2021, 01:23 - Sandeepti Singh: No no I found it a little funny
15/11/2021, 01:23 - Sandeepti Singh: At least the vignesh thing is done with
15/11/2021, 01:24 - Tara: Indeed
15/11/2021, 01:24 - Tara: Now Vinayak /s
15/11/2021, 01:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lmao
15/11/2021, 01:25 - Sandeepti Singh: He’s not done anything so I’m gonna assume that sarthak’s assumption is wrong
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Now I’m off to read and cry before I sleep
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Tara: Why you cry
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Sandeepti Singh: We’ve been over this??? For the most part no logical explanation
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Sandeepti Singh: But I’ve decided the embrace the crying
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Sandeepti Singh: And just let it happen
15/11/2021, 01:26 - Tara: Good! Release! Those! Emotions!
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Tara: Also I will always ask why you cry
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm sounds dirty but I’ll ignore that for now
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Tara: Girlie no!!
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah hahaha
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t get emotions though
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Tara: Sure
15/11/2021, 01:27 - Tara: Because crying != Emotions
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Haha I meant I don’t comprehend emotions
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: But that’s okay
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay well I mean it’s not
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: But I don’t have the time to deal with it
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay good night now
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Tara: I hope you'll make time one day
15/11/2021, 01:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I have lab tmr at 9
15/11/2021, 01:29 - Tara: To process everything
15/11/2021, 01:29 - Tara: Godspeed
15/11/2021, 01:29 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/11/2021, 13:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey when u have time can u copy paste our code on google doc I’ll go through it once just to double check
15/11/2021, 13:23 - Tara: Oui done this morning
15/11/2021, 15:11 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhh tara why did you remove code for count split and count go back and stuff
15/11/2021, 15:11 - Sandeepti Singh: car won't work without that
15/11/2021, 15:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i think our old code is correct so just copy paste in to the larger else statement
15/11/2021, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
15/11/2021, 15:35 - Sandeepti Singh: tbh we can't use most of their code cuz it's a completely different track
15/11/2021, 15:35 - Tara: it's not general?
15/11/2021, 15:35 - Tara: they're not doing anything sequentially
15/11/2021, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it won't be general because of the splits
15/11/2021, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: we need the code to be sequential for that one thing because the car encounters the same left sensor white and right seasor white 3 times but has to execute different codes
15/11/2021, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: i pasted some code at the end see if that makes sense
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Tara: wait then we can't go off the map in the lecture
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Sandeepti Singh: and feel free to add changes that i overlooked
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Sandeepti Singh: we can?
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Tara: if it's different than ours and theirs
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Sandeepti Singh: vignesh is not doing elec this sem bro
15/11/2021, 15:37 - Tara: oh right
15/11/2021, 15:38 - Sandeepti Singh: our map will be the same
15/11/2021, 15:38 - Sandeepti Singh: i put the code in vs code hahah i didn't wanna mess up the brackets
15/11/2021, 15:50 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh shit i just discovered a problem with out code
15/11/2021, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it's a void loop and we initialise variables inside then the variable just return to 0 each time it loops right
15/11/2021, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: we need to initialise the variables outside the loop?
15/11/2021, 15:54 - Sandeepti Singh: but idk how to do that because we're using the void loop function
15/11/2021, 15:55 - Sandeepti Singh: wait does that make sense? or am i overthinking
15/11/2021, 16:22 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm i mean i guess we could have a while(true) loop inside the main void loop() and just initialize the variable outside while loop so its the while loop that get's repeated infinitely not the void loop()
15/11/2021, 17:03 - Tara: i think you're overthinking this
15/11/2021, 17:03 - Tara: sid said dont put loops in your loop because it'll break
15/11/2021, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: just put it as gloabl variable then
15/11/2021, 19:09 - Sandeepti Singh: but we do need those variables for sure especially for the split
15/11/2021, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: can you just make that change and paste it to docs or do you want me to make the change on doc for you to copy
15/11/2021, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: okay nvm i just made the changes and pasted it on the doc
15/11/2021, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: tell me if something doesn't make sense
15/11/2021, 19:43 - Sandeepti Singh: also whatcha wearing for smart casual part of the photo shoot cuz I'm confused
15/11/2021, 20:02 - Tara: My normal ish clothes

16/11/2021, 19:29 - Sandeepti Singh: No
16/11/2021, 19:29 - Sandeepti Singh: They won’t say anything
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: And if they do then u can probs take it off and people won’t mind
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz it’s sorta isolated as in its sectioned off
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Tara: yeah
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Tara: thanks
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Np
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: And good luck
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Tara: another dude has his mask on too

16/11/2021, 19:30 - Tara: big thank
16/11/2021, 19:30 - Tara: i will
16/11/2021, 19:31 - Tara: hopefully
16/11/2021, 19:31 - Tara: it's only 1.5% of my grade
16/11/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
16/11/2021, 19:31 - Tara: hahahahha
16/11/2021, 19:31 - Tara: i love the eyebrows
16/11/2021, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA
16/11/2021, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Apparently if we pass early demo we don’t have to do actual demo
16/11/2021, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: So let’s go to the extra times the lts are open and try finishing it by the early demo time
16/11/2021, 19:35 - Tara: oui
16/11/2021, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey do you mind adding a quick thing to code
16/11/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: So have when !leftsensor and !rightsensor and countsplit > 2
16/11/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: And make it turn left for now?
16/11/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Make sure that countsplit actually goes up to 3 after the 3rd countsplit
16/11/2021, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: This is placeholder code for the 90 degree turn for the time being just in car
16/11/2021, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Case*
16/11/2021, 23:49 - Tara: Ok
16/11/2021, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Hiyaaaa
16/11/2021, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: How was Fina?
17/11/2021, 00:43 - Tara: Hello
17/11/2021, 00:43 - Tara: It was fine
17/11/2021, 02:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Good
17/11/2021, 02:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Also lol I legit woke up from sleep cuz I remembered that the first part of the code (before the car needs to go backwards) should be in an ig statement of if countWallGoBack == 0
17/11/2021, 02:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Goodnight
17/11/2021, 02:35 - Tara: Oh ok yeah I'll add that
17/11/2021, 02:35 - Tara: Were you dreaming about the code because same
17/11/2021, 02:37 - Tara: Goodnight
17/11/2021, 10:36 - Sandeepti Singh: HHaha no I was trying to fall asleep and the code kept coming to me lol
17/11/2021, 10:40 - Tara: Oh my
17/11/2021, 10:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea so let’s finish this project so I can get back my beauty sleep hahah
17/11/2021, 10:42 - Tara: I had this dream where we were visiting my mom's aunt and uncle in America and the aunt was pretty dismissive of us and at one point she literally said you need to go
So I woke up and realised I was going to be late for class
17/11/2021, 10:42 - Tara: Yes ma'am
17/11/2021, 10:42 - Sandeepti Singh: We as in u and I?

17/11/2021, 10:44 - Tara: Next time i decide to embark on an independent project can you slap me
17/11/2021, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: I can slap u even when you don’t embark on a independent project bjt sure
17/11/2021, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: What did u do this time?
17/11/2021, 10:45 - Tara: It's hard
17/11/2021, 10:45 - Tara: And time consuming
17/11/2021, 12:30 - Sandeepti Singh: But what is it?
17/11/2021, 14:18 - Tara: Machine learning and pairs trading between the FTSE100 closing price and the USD/GBP exchange rate
17/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Ah damn
17/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Smort
17/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: But if u learn stuff from it and u enjoy it then do it
17/11/2021, 14:42 - Tara: Nyehhhhhh
17/11/2021, 14:43 - Tara: Yeah
17/11/2021, 14:43 - Tara: I guess so

19/11/2021, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg for the 4th split it should go right not right
19/11/2021, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: As in when count split == 3 go right
19/11/2021, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: For the 90 degree turn
19/11/2021, 17:12 - Tara: Ah right
19/11/2021, 17:12 - Tara: I'll change it
19/11/2021, 17:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks but I’ll def go through why it was going backward in the beginning lol
19/11/2021, 17:13 - Sandeepti Singh: So I’ll probs edit the code a bit
19/11/2021, 18:10 - Sandeepti Singh: hey i'm free now
19/11/2021, 18:10 - Sandeepti Singh: if you free now can you just put the code lol
19/11/2021, 18:12 - Tara: I'm going home rn
19/11/2021, 18:12 - Tara: I'll add it when I get home
19/11/2021, 18:13 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh okay i'll also do it later then
19/11/2021, 18:15 - Sandeepti Singh: oh but paste the code from the word doc lol
19/11/2021, 18:15 - Sandeepti Singh: it's an older version but towards the end the car went crazy lol
19/11/2021, 18:15 - Sandeepti Singh: so i'll just modify the older version again
19/11/2021, 20:17 - Tara: Are you going to campus tomorrow
19/11/2021, 20:18 - Sandeepti Singh: probably noy
19/11/2021, 20:18 - Sandeepti Singh: becayse we have all of monday to test the car
19/11/2021, 20:18 - Sandeepti Singh: the other's don't have that
19/11/2021, 20:18 - Sandeepti Singh: but we can use the LT on Monday
19/11/2021, 20:23 - Tara: yeah fair enoug
19/11/2021, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah if we really need to we can ask for their map on Monday evening
19/11/2021, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: also text me when you finish uploading the code
19/11/2021, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i mean copy pasting the code
19/11/2021, 20:29 - Tara: the one from page 19 right
19/11/2021, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: pg 19 of the gdox? that's the old code
19/11/2021, 20:32 - Sandeepti Singh: doesn't hace the middle sensor
19/11/2021, 20:32 - Tara: oh yes ofc
19/11/2021, 20:32 - Tara: one second
19/11/2021, 20:36 - Sandeepti Singh: i think i copy pasted it onto a new word doc on your laptop
19/11/2021, 20:37 - Tara: yeah found it
19/11/2021, 20:38 - Tara: Are you doing any winter courses
19/11/2021, 20:38 - Sandeepti Singh: dunno yet
19/11/2021, 20:38 - Sandeepti Singh: u?
19/11/2021, 20:38 - Tara: ya
19/11/2021, 20:38 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh which ones(s)
19/11/2021, 20:48 - Tara: either sosc or isom
19/11/2021, 20:48 - Tara: there's this R programming course I want to do but can't because prerequisites :)
19/11/2021, 20:49 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh yea if i took a course it'd be that too
19/11/2021, 21:19 - Tara: this is happening already
19/11/2021, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: oh really i think i know the problem with that
19/11/2021, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: before when we had two sensors that would have worked
19/11/2021, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: but now with 3 sensors all ofthem would be white
19/11/2021, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: so we need an additional if statement for that
19/11/2021, 21:21 - Sandeepti Singh: just paste the code on gdocs but like a new one? the old one is too long
19/11/2021, 21:21 - Tara: i can delete everythign
19/11/2021, 21:22 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah that works too gaga
19/11/2021, 21:22 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
19/11/2021, 21:27 - Tara: ok this is unrelated but vscode has an arduino extension
19/11/2021, 21:27 - Tara: which is pretty neat
19/11/2021, 21:27 - Tara: however it doesn't work properly because i don't have the nano thing with me
19/11/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: oh damn really
19/11/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
19/11/2021, 21:30 - Tara: ive copied it over
19/11/2021, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: do you wanna try increasing the speed?
19/11/2021, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: or should we do it after one successful trial
19/11/2021, 21:42 - Tara: after would be better
19/11/2021, 21:43 - Sandeepti Singh: okay
19/11/2021, 21:46 - Sandeepti Singh: new code pasted
19/11/2021, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh hopefully it works
19/11/2021, 21:52 - Tara: 🤞
20/11/2021, 00:05 - Tara: You deleted this message

20/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: so idk it's broader and she can pick when it suits her
20/11/2021, 14:32 - Tara: yeah ok
20/11/2021, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it's weird they want us to reply by having their email in our reply and just putting an x?
20/11/2021, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: like i feel weird doing at and no longer know if that's right hahah
20/11/2021, 14:38 - Tara: i wrote why i cant make it

21/11/2021, 10:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Not me having to yell Vinayak that I haven’t done the hw for physics yet even though I did it like on Wednesday cuz otherwise he’ll just ask me for answers
21/11/2021, 10:51 - Sandeepti Singh: And I think I may be too nice giving him answers to 2-4 questions every single time
21/11/2021, 11:04 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
21/11/2021, 11:38 - Tara: Yes you have been

21/11/2021, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Same lol. The fact that circuits slash coding is my life now
21/11/2021, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Is chill inducing

21/11/2021, 21:11 - Tara: In IB I did better in physics than maths
21/11/2021, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay now off to ignore the pain and do some maths
21/11/2021, 21:11 - Tara: Here I'm doing better in maths than physics
21/11/2021, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Get this: I just finished a physics chapter so as a fucking reward to myself I get to do maths for a bit instead)
21/11/2021, 21:12 - Tara: That's awesome
21/11/2021, 21:12 - Tara: You don't even have to think

21/11/2021, 21:14 - Tara: I definitely had a breakdown over the elec courses and C fucking ++
21/11/2021, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep I can see why
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Tara: Soul sucking
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I am having a breakdown of my own
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Tara: Literally
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Tara: The maths pathway is so goddamn chill
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Tara: I have so much empty space
21/11/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah like a constant dull pain on what is my sad existence

I'm ready to give up ESA and ECESA for it
21/11/2021, 21:16 - Sandeepti Singh: As long as it’s something that doesn’t give me a breakdown every 10 min it’s already much better than beginning
21/11/2021, 21:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg no

21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: We're not too ignorant though
21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: Oh god we're being selective
21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: AI and segregation are important topics
21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: But they're not presented in the media much
21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: Hence we don't care
21/11/2021, 22:24 - Tara: My god
21/11/2021, 22:25 - Tara: But DNA testing >>>

22/11/2021, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Send me the robot video pls
22/11/2021, 21:33 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/11/2021, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: okay i'm writing alternate codes for faster speed/ and i also have an idea for the sharp turn so I'll write another code for that
22/11/2021, 22:01 - Sandeepti Singh: once you get back can you copy paste the code though? i forgot the condition for the sharp turn right after the 3rd split
22/11/2021, 22:01 - Tara: ye ok
22/11/2021, 22:01 - Sandeepti Singh: danke
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Tara: copied
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Sandeepti Singh: tell me if this makes sense
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Sandeepti Singh: for the sharp tunr
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Sandeepti Singh: when all  3 sensors are while turn left and delay?
22/11/2021, 22:03 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe it wans't working cuz we didn't have the delay
22/11/2021, 22:04 - Tara: yeah that makes snse
22/11/2021, 22:04 - Sandeepti Singh: okay so i'll make one current version while adding this  and then have a version with the faster speed just so we can try that out too
22/11/2021, 22:04 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz right now ours would take like 40ish seconds to complete lol
22/11/2021, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: bro this is older version of the code?
22/11/2021, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: look at wall go back
22/11/2021, 22:08 - Sandeepti Singh: it doesn't have that delay thing i put in
22/11/2021, 22:09 - Tara: this one ok?
22/11/2021, 22:09 - Tara: sorry i realised i have two files called logic 2
22/11/2021, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yup
22/11/2021, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: it's okieeee
22/11/2021, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: oh charge the car pls
22/11/2021, 22:19 - Tara: oh right yeah
22/11/2021, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: also how did we not think of adding the delay thing for the sharp tunr before lol
22/11/2021, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: like it could totoally be wrong but how did we not already think of trying it out
23/11/2021, 10:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Good morning! What time we meeting
23/11/2021, 10:47 - Tara: Hello
23/11/2021, 10:48 - Tara: So the thing is at 2 right
23/11/2021, 10:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea but we also took out the sensors

25/11/2021, 08:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I’m not sure if they’ll open the rooms in the evening anymore
25/11/2021, 08:04 - Sandeepti Singh: To make it fair
25/11/2021, 08:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Tmr is also 9am so doesn’t make much difference
25/11/2021, 08:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Let’s meet at 9:15?
25/11/2021, 08:05 - Sandeepti Singh: But pls do be there (you have the robot) hahah

25/11/2021, 08:24 - Tara: That's fine
25/11/2021, 08:25 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
25/11/2021, 08:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I stg social media stalks  me
25/11/2021, 08:45 - Tara: <Media omitted>

25/11/2021, 08:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea trueee
25/11/2021, 08:47 - Sandeepti Singh: (Not like I wake up easily in summer though hahah)
25/11/2021, 08:50 - Tara: Ha I don't think we've had this many breakdowns in a week
25/11/2021, 08:50 - Tara: Are you ok
25/11/2021, 08:50 - Tara: Genuinely
25/11/2021, 08:53 - Sandeepti Singh: No but yes
25/11/2021, 08:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Like no cuz I’m so behind for everything
25/11/2021, 08:54 - Sandeepti Singh: But yes for I shall be fine
25/11/2021, 08:54 - Sandeepti Singh: What about u?
25/11/2021, 08:54 - Tara: After this week is over I'll be fine
25/11/2021, 08:54 - Tara: Because I'll actually get to study
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s good
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Sandeepti Singh: We just need to get our car working everytime
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Tara: I'm gonna get such low grades this term
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Sandeepti Singh: I think part of the reason it wasn’t working yesterday was uneven flooring
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Tara: Agreed
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Same. I wanna say I have given up but it sucks that this is me trying my best
25/11/2021, 08:55 - Sandeepti Singh: And it’s still nowhere near enough for ust
25/11/2021, 08:56 - Tara: I hope we don't get into our winter courses so we can Relax
25/11/2021, 08:56 - Tara: A Tiny Bit
25/11/2021, 08:56 - Tara: Also do you want to stay for lunch at Oliver's
25/11/2021, 08:56 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Tara: We may meet Yuen Yin's roommate
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll see? Probably not though tbh
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Tara: If we're not then I'm not going
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Sandeepti Singh: I also have a question for u that I shall ask u when we meet
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Remind me pls
25/11/2021, 08:57 - Tara: Ok
25/11/2021, 09:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Where do u wanna meet btw?
25/11/2021, 09:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Is the classroom near the lt from yesterday?
25/11/2021, 09:12 - Tara: I think it's the engineering commons?
25/11/2021, 09:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh okay I’ll cya there
25/11/2021, 09:12 - Tara: Ok see you
25/11/2021, 09:19 - Tara: Oh whoops it's not the commons
25/11/2021, 09:19 - Tara: It's the floor below
25/11/2021, 09:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol I’m right behind u
25/11/2021, 09:19 - Tara: Hello
25/11/2021, 10:36 - Sandeepti Singh: is the arduino upload thing working on mine
25/11/2021, 10:36 - Sandeepti Singh: there was no delay in the behinning??? like why are there problems with the code suddebtly
25/11/2021, 10:37 - Tara: Huh weird
25/11/2021, 10:37 - Tara: Could you borrow someone's laptop and upload it
25/11/2021, 11:31 - Sandeepti Singh: what time will your class finish
25/11/2021, 11:31 - Sandeepti Singh: our robot currently won't go past second split so we're at 8/20 points
25/11/2021, 11:32 - Tara: In a couple of minutes
25/11/2021, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: can you be here before they close it
25/11/2021, 11:33 - Tara: Yes
25/11/2021, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: okay they said at 50 they'll fold the mats
25/11/2021, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: as in not stop lines
25/11/2021, 11:35 - Sandeepti Singh: so just hurry if possible
25/11/2021, 11:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't kbow if they have anymore trial time after tmr morning
25/11/2021, 12:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay so we def go to the elec thing tmr and we go on time
25/11/2021, 12:05 - Tara: Yes
25/11/2021, 12:05 - Tara: Which means

25/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Tell me
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Tara: Guess
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Tara: We were right
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Ikemura
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Tara: Yep
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
25/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: She should just ask him out lol
25/11/2021, 13:34 - Tara: I told her that too
25/11/2021, 13:34 - Tara: We need to orchestrate this
25/11/2021, 13:34 - Tara: Somehow
25/11/2021, 15:42 - Sandeepti Singh: hahha
25/11/2021, 15:42 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
25/11/2021, 15:43 - Sandeepti Singh: oh also did siyoon say anything about the date she went on?
25/11/2021, 15:43 - Sandeepti Singh: i think she's into ikemura but said yes to other guy cuz of let's see what happens you know
25/11/2021, 15:59 - Tara: Yeah she said it was awkward
25/11/2021, 15:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lol
25/11/2021, 17:01 - Tara: im lending the battery charger to siyoon
25/11/2021, 17:01 - Tara: because their final demo is tomorrow
25/11/2021, 17:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay but is our charged?
25/11/2021, 17:02 - Tara: yes
25/11/2021, 17:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay as long as ours is fully charged it’s no problem
25/11/2021, 17:03 - Sandeepti Singh: If it’s not fully charged then I mean it shouldn’t take too long to charge it before giving it to siyoon
25/11/2021, 17:03 - Tara: it's completely charged
25/11/2021, 17:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I just saw the msg on the  gc
25/11/2021, 17:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Okie no biggie then
25/11/2021, 17:03 - Tara: 👍\
25/11/2021, 17:06 - Tara: i cant believe im saying this but im so excited to study for something that's not comp or elec now
25/11/2021, 17:07 - Tara: or chinese
25/11/2021, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
25/11/2021, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i feel like i'm Sisyphus from that myth of sisyphus right now with physics
25/11/2021, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i finish 2 chapter 2 more get done
25/11/2021, 19:03 - Tara: :(((((
25/11/2021, 19:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
25/11/2021, 19:05 - Tara: oml i need to read this
25/11/2021, 19:05 - Sandeepti Singh: ahahahha
25/11/2021, 19:05 - Tara: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53310061-dial-a-for-aunties?from_choice=true
25/11/2021, 19:05 - Sandeepti Singh: after finals
25/11/2021, 19:06 - Tara: oh bruh i opened chrome to work on finance
opened my gmail
read some emails
then closed the window??
25/11/2021, 19:06 - Tara: instead of working??
25/11/2021, 19:07 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
25/11/2021, 19:07 - Tara: what are you working on now
25/11/2021, 19:08 - Tara: man im freezing
my room seems to be colder than outside
25/11/2021, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: finishing up mastering physics so i can start a new physics chapter
25/11/2021, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: also quick question what is our plan if we can't get the car working tmr?
25/11/2021, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: like there's genuinely a big possibility that we end up getting 8/20 for the demo
25/11/2021, 19:09 - Sandeepti Singh: do we have a backup plan?
25/11/2021, 19:10 - Tara: i'll ask sid if he printed the map
25/11/2021, 19:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't think they did and even if they did i don't think it'll be useful cuz different material/ different shade of colors
25/11/2021, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: they will have different values and won't really help out
25/11/2021, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: the only thing i can think of is decrease the sensitivity of the sensor to about medium and decrease the delay to mid/low 100s and see if that does it
25/11/2021, 19:12 - Sandeepti Singh: and before the actual demo we have to properly tune our sensors in the elc room and on the actual final demo mat
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: but white is just anything that's not black
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: and black would be black
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: and i'll cya at like 8:45 in the eng commons
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: we should still try
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: if they
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: 've printed it
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Tara: ok
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: not really. different materials and differnet shades will have a different reflective ability
25/11/2021, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: /absorption ability
25/11/2021, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: i guess we could practice tuning sensors on the map but yea i don't think they printed it
25/11/2021, 19:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
25/11/2021, 19:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha she’ll probs look good in them
25/11/2021, 19:44 - Sandeepti Singh: No need to worry
25/11/2021, 19:44 - Tara: But bangs
25/11/2021, 19:44 - Tara: I will disown her
25/11/2021, 19:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
25/11/2021, 19:52 - Tara: I 99.9% of the time don't care about people's appearances
Unless they have bangs
25/11/2021, 20:02 - Tara: Oh bro
25/11/2021, 20:02 - Tara: I have some tea
25/11/2021, 20:02 - Tara: Siyoon thinks Vignesh is into her
25/11/2021, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Vignesh or Vinayak?
25/11/2021, 20:03 - Tara: He kept messaging her in the morning saying yo remember xyz
Bought her chocolate
25/11/2021, 20:03 - Tara: Vignesh
25/11/2021, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lmao
25/11/2021, 20:03 - Tara: Ha I told her I would only tell you
25/11/2021, 20:04 - Tara: She now understands that whatever she tells me I'm gonna tell you
25/11/2021, 20:04 - Tara: And vice versa hopefully
25/11/2021, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yea off
25/11/2021, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Ofc
25/11/2021, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey
25/11/2021, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Can I ask u for a favour tmr?
25/11/2021, 23:29 - Tara: Yes
25/11/2021, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol ask what it is first before agreeing
25/11/2021, 23:32 - Tara: Ok what's the favour
25/11/2021, 23:32 - Tara: I'm simply a good friend
25/11/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Too long to explain lol I’ll just tell u tmr and u can choose
25/11/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Related to comp and should take 5 min
25/11/2021, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Ur not helping me write a code or anything
25/11/2021, 23:39 - Tara: Yeah I'll do it anyway
25/11/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks
26/11/2021, 01:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea cya at 8:45 in eng commons so we can be on time
26/11/2021, 01:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanna tune out sensors to be less sensitive
26/11/2021, 01:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I realised the one time it finished the whole course was when the room was dark
26/11/2021, 01:45 - Sandeepti Singh: So there was no extra interference from the room light
26/11/2021, 01:45 - Sandeepti Singh: So it might just be that our sensor is too sensitive and that if we fix that it should work
26/11/2021, 08:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Ang commons is closed
26/11/2021, 08:43 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m sitting outside
26/11/2021, 08:46 - Sandeepti Singh: When U coming?
26/11/2021, 08:48 - Sandeepti Singh: I guess I’ll head towards the room for today
26/11/2021, 08:48 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s near LT L
26/11/2021, 08:52 - Tara: Ah sorry I'm on my way
26/11/2021, 09:00 - Tara: Hello where are you
26/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh make sure that u don’t copy the code off google docs cuz that’s an older version
26/11/2021, 13:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Use the one from arduino
26/11/2021, 13:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Hopefully I saved the newest version
26/11/2021, 13:34 - Sandeepti Singh: But also text me when u submit so I can double check the code just to be sure
26/11/2021, 13:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Also no way we give Vinayak our code cuz plagiarism checkers. If he asks u just say u can help with general logic
26/11/2021, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also can I get the Apple Pencil tip from u on Monday?
26/11/2021, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: ma'am you are leaving me on read too often
26/11/2021, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 16:24 - Tara: Huh
26/11/2021, 16:24 - Tara: I was sleeping
26/11/2021, 16:25 - Tara: Yes to everything
26/11/2021, 16:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Haha
26/11/2021, 16:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh just a reminder we need to increase the final delay (after wallgoback) by a little bit
26/11/2021, 16:36 - Tara: Yep
26/11/2021, 17:10 - Tara: I'm gonna make the code look Pretty ✨
26/11/2021, 17:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 17:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 17:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 17:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 18:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Pls be very very very very careful 👉👈
26/11/2021, 18:43 - Sandeepti Singh: If the wrong code gets dubmitt I will just unaligned myself
26/11/2021, 18:46 - Tara: You'll what now
26/11/2021, 18:46 - Tara: Oui madame
26/11/2021, 18:47 - Tara: I'll submit one pretty code
26/11/2021, 18:47 - Tara: And the original
26/11/2021, 18:47 - Tara: Without the prettiness
26/11/2021, 18:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah okay
26/11/2021, 18:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Unalive*
26/11/2021, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: But if I’m being honest that doesn’t seem smart. Like idk it might be better to just submit one version
26/11/2021, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz sometimes the first time of the version doesn’t work
26/11/2021, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Like right after we upload it
26/11/2021, 19:00 - Sandeepti Singh: I’d say just double check the working version and submit that since we tested that u know
26/11/2021, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Super easy to make tiny ass errors especially cuz we don’t have time to check if it’ll upload (I have Board but not arduino software
26/11/2021, 19:01 - Tara: I thought you downloaded it yesterday
26/11/2021, 19:01 - Tara: I'll check the code when I get home
26/11/2021, 19:02 - Tara: Bruh my dad just switched like four lanes in a row
26/11/2021, 19:02 - Tara: Autotoll is in lane 1/6
We were in lane 5
Then he just switched to lane 1?
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHAHA
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: I DID but it won’t work
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Tara: Oh F
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: I had to use Ikemura’s laptop
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Tara: Ohhh
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Tara: Understood
26/11/2021, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: I asked Vinayak first (cuz I don’t really know ikemura) and he legit said no
26/11/2021, 19:05 - Sandeepti Singh: And then now won’t hesitate to ask for my whole code lol
26/11/2021, 19:05 - Tara: Ah I remember you telling me this
26/11/2021, 19:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Ye I’m not a fan of his hahaha
26/11/2021, 19:05 - Tara: 🩴
26/11/2021, 19:06 - Tara: Are you coming to campus on Monday
26/11/2021, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: I have to
26/11/2021, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: For photoshoot
26/11/2021, 19:12 - Sandeepti Singh: For SA
26/11/2021, 19:15 - Tara: Ok
26/11/2021, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Why do u ask?
26/11/2021, 19:16 - Tara: I dunno
26/11/2021, 20:04 - Tara: Ehneeway
26/11/2021, 20:04 - Tara: Was it worth it? Probably not
26/11/2021, 20:10 - Tara: Oh we should take a photo of the car and circuit
26/11/2021, 20:10 - Tara: For the report
26/11/2021, 20:10 - Tara: I'm gonna film the robot on Tuesday
26/11/2021, 20:11 - Tara: Hmm and I guess we should make a flowchart
26/11/2021, 20:35 - Tara: ma'am i am having a Terrible Time acting normal in front of family
26/11/2021, 20:35 - Tara: i will simply hide
26/11/2021, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA just stay in ur room ma’am
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: You have a lot to study hahah
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: yeah they're gone
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: and sister is just watching tv
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: i will Work
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: and be Productiv
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: e
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Tara: also are you doing anything for nye
26/11/2021, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t think so
26/11/2021, 21:09 - Tara: good
26/11/2021, 21:09 - Tara: we hang out
26/11/2021, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Okieee
26/11/2021, 21:11 - Tara: finger guns
26/11/2021, 21:11 - Tara: i dare you
26/11/2021, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha no ma’am
26/11/2021, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: I am genuinely gonna google some poses though
26/11/2021, 21:13 - Tara: yeah and practise them
26/11/2021, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I panic on spot and can’t think of any haha
26/11/2021, 21:13 - Tara: i will pay you if you do finger guns
26/11/2021, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: How much we talking?
26/11/2021, 21:14 - Tara: $25
26/11/2021, 21:14 - Tara: -50
26/11/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm interesting
26/11/2021, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I accept the chankenge at 50 bucks
26/11/2021, 21:16 - Tara: you got it
26/11/2021, 21:16 - Tara: i'll need to see proof though
26/11/2021, 21:16 - Tara: how about this
10 now
40 when i see the photo
26/11/2021, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: 🤝
26/11/2021, 21:19 - Tara: wonderful
26/11/2021, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
26/11/2021, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted

26/11/2021, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
26/11/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh what did we end up putting for final delay
26/11/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m too ceebs to do physics tonight so I’m thinking of just finishing the report lol
26/11/2021, 23:31 - Tara: final final delay 3000
26/11/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I mean the one right before.
26/11/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Like how long until the robot stops at the corner
26/11/2021, 23:31 - Tara: 520
26/11/2021, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh we gotta increase that to 600 ish?
26/11/2021, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz it’s okay if it goes back farther but it shouldn’t stop too soon
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: I found this in my voice memos
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Wanna know what it is?
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Tara: yes
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: A secret voice recording of my brother singing like shit
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Tara: if it's me talking
up yo game
26/11/2021, 23:39 - Tara: oh lmao
26/11/2021, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: I forgot I took that HAHAH
26/11/2021, 23:40 - Tara: what's he singing
26/11/2021, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Not discernible
26/11/2021, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: The singing is that bad
26/11/2021, 23:40 - Tara: hahahahhaa
27/11/2021, 00:21 - Tara: I'm making the flowchart now
27/11/2021, 00:21 - Tara: i'll share it once im done
27/11/2021, 00:22 - Tara: Nvm I've been told to sleep
I'll finish it in the morning and send it to you
27/11/2021, 00:22 - Tara: Goodnight
27/11/2021, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha okay
27/11/2021, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Gn
27/11/2021, 00:31 - Tara: Bro I got such a weird phone call
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: Someone from hall 7 asked me about Aryavardhan(?)
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: Agarwal
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: Because on the 9th Simar asked me to sign him in
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: So I did and left
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: Then they're like oh he's gone missing?
27/11/2021, 00:32 - Tara: Like bruh
27/11/2021, 00:33 - Tara: Also I saw him a couple of days ago in a lift
27/11/2021, 00:33 - Tara: Ugh gotta talk to Simar
27/11/2021, 00:40 - Tara: Do you know him
27/11/2021, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Not really
27/11/2021, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Hansika got the same call right now
27/11/2021, 01:00 - Tara: Huh weird
27/11/2021, 01:00 - Tara: What did they say
27/11/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk he’s just missing
27/11/2021, 14:11 - Tara: Hmm how complicated are flowcharts supposed to be
27/11/2021, 14:12 - Tara: Because this is complicated
27/11/2021, 14:12 - Tara: It don't matter
27/11/2021, 14:12 - Tara: I guess efje's was just really simple
27/11/2021, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh i'll help with flowchart?
27/11/2021, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: we can have the same flowchart and logic table right
27/11/2021, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: so maybe i can either help u with flowchart or i can make the logic table
27/11/2021, 14:28 - Tara: could you make the table
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: yup np but i can't make it now
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Tara: i've made a flowchart but it's ugly
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i kinda wanna work on phsyics a bit first
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Tara: so i'm going to remake it
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Tara: yeah np we have a week anyway
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: knowing me i'll probably procrastinate on doing physics and make the flowchart first
27/11/2021, 14:29 - Tara: No
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Tara: you study
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm ngl i put off doing phsyics and end up doing stuff for every other subject first haha
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: like i'm on top of all my hw exclusively cuz i put off physics and od other stuff
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: useful prorastination?
27/11/2021, 14:30 - Tara: no not really you're seven chapters behind
27/11/2021, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: yes : ( okay i'll do physics now
27/11/2021, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: done with comp assingment though including memory leak
27/11/2021, 14:31 - Tara: ayyyy
27/11/2021, 14:31 - Tara: that's good
27/11/2021, 14:31 - Tara: i hope you get 100%
27/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah sid ended up helping a bit cuz my code was passing like 43/44 trdt cases but had memory leak in 1
27/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: so he randomly ended up helping despite my protests
27/11/2021, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: okay bye now
27/11/2021, 14:32 - Tara: bai
27/11/2021, 15:13 - Tara: huh weird
there's a statement that assigns 1 to speedControl but it's written as speedControl == 1 instead of =
27/11/2021, 15:13 - Tara: but it still works
27/11/2021, 15:14 - Tara: as in both versions compile
27/11/2021, 15:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh shit
27/11/2021, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I did always get sus as to why the speed doesn’t decrease significantly even though it goes from 200 to 50
27/11/2021, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Maybe we should ask Vinayak for the mat so we can try it out with a single =
27/11/2021, 15:15 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/11/2021, 15:15 - Tara: yep
27/11/2021, 15:16 - Tara: the annoying is that there's no overlap with any of the processes
27/11/2021, 15:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao did I come up with a logic that complex without realising hahah
27/11/2021, 15:16 - Tara: oui
27/11/2021, 15:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay I’ll text him about it later on and then bring robot on Monday
27/11/2021, 15:16 - Tara: thanks
27/11/2021, 15:17 - Tara: is it illegal to have a flowchart that flows upwards
27/11/2021, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: No
27/11/2021, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno
27/11/2021, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Shouldn’t be
27/11/2021, 15:18 - Tara: i shall ask me friends
27/11/2021, 15:18 - Tara: it better not be because then it won't fit on the page
27/11/2021, 15:18 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/11/2021, 15:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
27/11/2021, 15:19 - Tara: i- well we're going to have to dedicate an entire page to the chart
27/11/2021, 15:19 - Tara: we have six pages
27/11/2021, 15:19 - Tara: it'll be fine
27/11/2021, 15:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
27/11/2021, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Our logic table will also be bigger cuz 3 line sensor
27/11/2021, 15:22 - Tara: :')
27/11/2021, 15:22 - Tara: ha that itself will probably be its own page
27/11/2021, 15:23 - Tara: we can't have tables that extend over two pages
27/11/2021, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll try to keep it to half a page
27/11/2021, 15:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Max 3/4th
27/11/2021, 15:26 - Tara: <Media omitted>
27/11/2021, 16:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Technically speaking countsplit 0 and 1 can be combined
27/11/2021, 16:16 - Tara: the delays are slightly different
27/11/2021, 16:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah so you can just have it split on the delay bit
27/11/2021, 16:17 - Tara: oh oh yeah
27/11/2021, 16:17 - Tara: there's another condition
27/11/2021, 16:17 - Tara: yes
27/11/2021, 16:17 - Tara: i'll change it
27/11/2021, 16:17 - Sandeepti Singh: And tbh the difference in delay isn’t important
27/11/2021, 16:18 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s different only cuz the sensors weren’t working and I was trying random stuff but don’t wanna change it just in case hahah
27/11/2021, 16:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also countsplit greater than 2 is the same as countsplit 0 and 1
27/11/2021, 16:18 - Sandeepti Singh: With dif delay
27/11/2021, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
27/11/2021, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I haven’t looked at the code so I could be wrong but I think this was legit
27/11/2021, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Left*
27/11/2021, 16:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also for speed control did we put greater than 3 or >= 3
27/11/2021, 16:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz if it’s the former then it’ll never get implemented
27/11/2021, 16:22 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
27/11/2021, 16:22 - Tara: >= 2
27/11/2021, 16:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep makes sense
27/11/2021, 16:23 - Sandeepti Singh: I implemented it after the 3rd split
27/11/2021, 16:23 - Sandeepti Singh: The split goes to max of 3 and never gets to 4
27/11/2021, 16:32 - Tara: ok i've changed the stuff
27/11/2021, 16:32 - Tara: and ive added colours
27/11/2021, 16:32 - Tara: because why not
27/11/2021, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea I’m looking at the recorded video and the speed doesn’t actually decrease
27/11/2021, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: But if it work like that we leave it like that?
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually no u sent me two vids (or I have two vids) idk
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Sandeepti Singh: But one of them it changes and for one it doesn’t?
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Tara: we can try both on monday
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I texted Vinayak like 2 and a half hours ago but he hasn’t responded
27/11/2021, 17:41 - Sandeepti Singh: So idk if he’ll give lol
27/11/2021, 17:42 - Tara: he said he will
we can ask on monday again
27/11/2021, 17:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay
27/11/2021, 17:42 - Tara: also on monday remember to take your nibs
27/11/2021, 17:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah
28/11/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/11/2021, 00:50 - Sandeepti Singh: oh did you not make the changes for the split bit? only 2 would be needed instead of 3 and will save sapce
28/11/2021, 00:51 - Sandeepti Singh: if not can't change it then can you send me the link or something of where you worked on this so i can make a different copy with some changes
28/11/2021, 00:52 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm yeah this might just be an older version? cuz it has the same problems as the last one
28/11/2021, 01:43 - Sandeepti Singh: also we didn't end up using countSharptunr so it doesn't need to be part fo the logic flwo
28/11/2021, 11:15 - Sandeepti Singh: 1.👆 and 2. Vinayak is purposely not reading my message lol so Idk if he’ll give us the mat
28/11/2021, 11:19 - Tara: Yeah sorry I just woke up
28/11/2021, 11:19 - Tara: I'll send it in a bit
28/11/2021, 11:19 - Tara: Also sis chill he said he'll give it to us after his demo
28/11/2021, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but like I sent the text yesterday at 3 and last online was after that but like he ain’t even seen the message
28/11/2021, 12:41 - Tara: i did
this is the old version
28/11/2021, 12:42 - Tara: i havent sent you the new version
28/11/2021, 12:44 - Tara: app.diagrams.net
open it with this if you can
28/11/2021, 14:42 - Tara: Does X just mean 0/1
28/11/2021, 14:42 - Tara: In the logic table
28/11/2021, 14:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah X is doesn’t matter
28/11/2021, 14:43 - Tara: Also does >0 but <2 mean 1
28/11/2021, 14:43 - Tara: Or does it go up to 2
28/11/2021, 14:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh change that two >=0 but <2
28/11/2021, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah it won't open so u'll have to update and send the correct version later on
28/11/2021, 14:52 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/11/2021, 14:53 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/11/2021, 14:54 - Tara: i increased the font size
28/11/2021, 14:58 - Sandeepti Singh: isn't the end suppose to be after the delay(3000)
28/11/2021, 14:59 - Tara: yep i just realised that too
28/11/2021, 15:00 - Tara: hmm something's wrong
28/11/2021, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: what?
28/11/2021, 15:02 - Tara: oh nvm fixed it
28/11/2021, 15:02 - Tara: i was trying to move some bits
28/11/2021, 15:02 - Tara: to make it fit on one page
28/11/2021, 15:02 - Tara: in the process i messed up the logic
28/11/2021, 15:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/11/2021, 17:27 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/11/2021, 17:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Us for elec up until the final demo
28/11/2021, 17:58 - Tara: Ma'am you sound like you're going to kill someone and steal their choice
28/11/2021, 17:58 - Tara: Code
28/11/2021, 17:59 - Tara: Also unrelated but I have reached a new level of no fucks given / sleepiness
I actually managed to properly sleep in the car on the way to campus
28/11/2021, 17:59 - Tara: No fake eye rest
28/11/2021, 18:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Ma’am did u see the gif? He prays at the end and that was us last time
28/11/2021, 18:06 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAU
28/11/2021, 18:06 - Tara: Oh sorry I watched half of it
28/11/2021, 18:07 - Tara: I will literally bring Jesus with me
28/11/2021, 18:07 - Tara: On Tuesday
28/11/2021, 18:07 - Tara: Idfc
28/11/2021, 18:07 - Tara: Update
I am now sleeping again
28/11/2021, 18:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yes
28/11/2021, 18:10 - Sandeepti Singh: I have a Buddha and a Ganesh anf I’ll bring them both

29/11/2021, 19:19 - Tara: siyoon told me that vignesh is friendly to her because sid asked him to be nicer to th girls in the group
29/11/2021, 19:20 - Tara: so it could just be that he's being friendly because of sid

29/11/2021, 19:21 - Tara: god half the group is made of low-key control freaks
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Think of it this way
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: If u organise it then u’ll not be able to experience finding out who the killer is
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Tara: true
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: And also no one will suspect u
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is worse
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Tara: that's the only downside
29/11/2021, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but it’s a pretty big downside lol
29/11/2021, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I wanna be that person who finds out the killer
29/11/2021, 19:24 - Tara: tbf im gonna plan everything else

29/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Eh not really. Like I did talk to people the whole time but not friend level
29/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Why didn’t Yuen yin get in 🥲
29/11/2021, 19:30 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m the only one from my interview group who got in I think
29/11/2021, 19:31 - Tara: aw that sucks
29/11/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but we were talking to the lady in charge
29/11/2021, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Like 8 of us

29/11/2021, 19:32 - Tara: ofc lah
29/11/2021, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: ALSO I guess it could just be cuz of the distinctive name
29/11/2021, 19:32 - Tara: or else you wouldn't have gotten in
29/11/2021, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Fair point
29/11/2021, 19:33 - Tara: bro the urge to just blast music in my room
29/11/2021, 19:33 - Tara: is too much
29/11/2021, 19:33 - Tara: ugh
29/11/2021, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I am almost constantly blasting music
29/11/2021, 19:34 - Tara: nvm my ears hurt
29/11/2021, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: In my ear phone though cuz swear words and parents don’t go together

29/11/2021, 19:36 - Tara: and blast it
29/11/2021, 19:38 - Sandeepti Singh: HHaha yes to everything but speeding up the song

29/11/2021, 19:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Like let’s meet earlier
29/11/2021, 19:39 - Sandeepti Singh: So we can check the sensors in general
29/11/2021, 19:40 - Sandeepti Singh: And that the wheels go in the right direction
29/11/2021, 19:40 - Tara: ye
29/11/2021, 19:40 - Sandeepti Singh: And also go through the whole code and if there are any changes required then we submit an updated version of the code
29/11/2021, 19:40 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/11/2021, 19:41 - Tara: i see you at 12 then?
29/11/2021, 19:41 - Tara: temperature

29/11/2021, 19:41 - Sandeepti Singh: 3
29/11/2021, 19:41 - Tara: remember we need to submit it by 3
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep so submit the current version of code (when speed control = 1)
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: For now
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay how about I come at 12:30
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: And we go though code
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Tara: ok
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: And then submit a new version if it neeeds to be changed
29/11/2021, 19:42 - Tara: oh shit no classes tomorrow
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Tara: i forgot about that
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Tara: yeah 12:30 is cool
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Can u submit a version now and tell me when u do it
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Sorry I’m so like control freak-y about the project haha
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Tara: nah it's chill
29/11/2021, 19:43 - Tara: gimme a couple of minutes though
29/11/2021, 19:44 - Tara: im making notes
29/11/2021, 19:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Yep no
29/11/2021, 19:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Np*
29/11/2021, 19:48 - Tara: uploaded
29/11/2021, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanku
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao my student id is wrong in the submitted file
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Tara: Oh no
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Tara: What's the right one
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i think when we did replace all it got changed
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Sandeepti Singh: mine's 20679259
29/11/2021, 22:59 - Tara: Oh right
29/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: bruh i'm so freaking out about the car for tmr
29/11/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh also yeah just whenever you update the flowchart send it over
29/11/2021, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i just that and conclusion (which I'm leaving until i see how the car actually works hahah) left
29/11/2021, 23:01 - Tara: ^
29/11/2021, 23:01 - Tara: I don't want to write this goddy report ugh
29/11/2021, 23:02 - Sandeepti Singh: the end is wrong
29/11/2021, 23:02 - Sandeepti Singh: everything else is correct although split (0 1) and 3 can be combined but it wouldn't;t make much difference so you can just let it be
29/11/2021, 23:03 - Tara: What's the end supposed to be
29/11/2021, 23:03 - Tara: One second
29/11/2021, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: after delay 3000
29/11/2021, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz that signals the car to stop
29/11/2021, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: that 3000 is basically telling the car to do nothing for 3 minutes
29/11/2021, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: 3 seconds oops
29/11/2021, 23:04 - Tara: Ah ok so append the end to the 3000 thing
29/11/2021, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: yup
29/11/2021, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: also couldn't you combine the go straight, left, right and only have on thing that goes after like is speedcontrol 0 and then just specify the speed
29/11/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: the thing''l become more compact but tbh don't bother if it's too much work
29/11/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it's right etiher wya
29/11/2021, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: um i was just looking at it and the middle bit is a bit wrong. i
29/11/2021, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: like the speed control bit
29/11/2021, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it sorta goes like speed control == 0 then goes no but the statement to increase the speedcontrol comes after
29/11/2021, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: so based on the flowchart it will never increase
29/11/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: just make it. is countsplit >= 2 (it say >3 which should be changed) --> yes then speed control is 1 and new PWM is 50
29/11/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: so you don'y have to have two separate go straight, go left., go right
29/11/2021, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: does that make sense?
29/11/2021, 23:11 - Sandeepti Singh: lol you can call me if that doesn't make sense cuz idk i can't type well
29/11/2021, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh btw is it okay if u get lunch before we meet?
29/11/2021, 23:48 - Tara: ja
29/11/2021, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: I have a lot of work so I might just study if we’re done with elec early
29/11/2021, 23:48 - Tara: mhm ok
29/11/2021, 23:49 - Tara: see you
29/11/2021, 23:49 - Tara: so we meet at 12:30?
29/11/2021, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup sure
30/11/2021, 12:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey I’ll be a bit late
30/11/2021, 12:11 - Tara: ok
30/11/2021, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: There was something wwrong not with my apple payments so I had to fix that
30/11/2021, 12:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Eng commons?
30/11/2021, 12:39 - Tara: Yes
30/11/2021, 16:28 - Tara: <Media omitted>
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Tara: Hey do you mind sending the message from Vinayak pls
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Tara: I'm complaining to people
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Tara: As you may have noticed it takes like an hour or so to fully comprehend what someone's done
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
30/11/2021, 17:25 - Tara: Thank you
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Tara: Bro I'm going to slander him
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Tara: To everyone j know
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I’m just never gonna speak to him on purpose
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Like if it’s a group or something sure I’ll say something if I have to
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: But just not gonna acknowledge his existence otherwise
30/11/2021, 17:26 - Tara: Yes
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Tara: Bruh we shouldn't have added him to the GC
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Tara: Now how do we remove them
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Tara: I guess we have the girls chat though
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh I can already imagine Sid immediately taking his side lol
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Which low-key sucks
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Tara: I hope he won't
30/11/2021, 17:27 - Tara: I've given a convincing argument
30/11/2021, 17:28 - Tara: Ya know what was off about him when we first met him? His eyebrows /s
30/11/2021, 17:28 - Tara: It's always the eyebrows
30/11/2021, 17:29 - Tara: I joke that one's eyebrows are an indication of their personality
30/11/2021, 17:29 - Tara: Usually
30/11/2021, 17:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh HAHHA
30/11/2021, 17:29 - Tara: Like I have a 75% success rate
30/11/2021, 17:31 - Tara: Bro
30/11/2021, 17:31 - Tara: They lied about the map being destroyed
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Tara: Remember yesterday Markus said he hid it behind the bin
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah ofc he did
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Like obviously they did
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Tara: Yeah it was obvious but I'm just remembering why it's so obvious
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Their score went up to 18 from like 4
30/11/2021, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: And their demo was yesterday
30/11/2021, 17:33 - Sandeepti Singh: And they said they were working on it like on Sunday too
30/11/2021, 17:33 - Sandeepti Singh: So like it’s okay if he passes comp cuz of someone else buy draws the line helping us out by just us a map that they would throw out anyway
30/11/2021, 17:33 - Sandeepti Singh: But like I don’t care
30/11/2021, 17:33 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s done with
30/11/2021, 17:50 - Tara: Welp just called mother and she roasted us for not printing the map and relying on him 🙃
30/11/2021, 17:51 - Tara: And now obviously she's getting me to calculate all my grades
30/11/2021, 17:51 - Sandeepti Singh: My gut told me not to trust him but I thought he’d give it
30/11/2021, 17:51 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought wrong
30/11/2021, 17:56 - Tara: I'm sorry I thought he would give the map as well

04/12/2021, 12:19 - Tara: Yeah it doesn't look right
04/12/2021, 12:20 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait it gives the same answer either way

04/12/2021, 12:21 - Tara: ???
04/12/2021, 12:21 - Sandeepti Singh: i think it's cuz of the way we multiply after

04/12/2021, 12:30 - Tara: Ok I'm sorry even if you're fine with it I'm confused
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: nope nope i figured it out
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: they did find the inverse and do it
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: they just ommited that step
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: to confuse the shit out of us
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i did it both ways and if i use what they did it won't work
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: so they presumably did find the inverse correctly
04/12/2021, 12:31 - Tara: Aight
04/12/2021, 12:32 - Tara: Bro these interviewers are so OP
04/12/2021, 12:32 - Sandeepti Singh: op?

04/12/2021, 12:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't think we do
04/12/2021, 12:56 - Sandeepti Singh: idk what's wrong
04/12/2021, 12:57 - Sandeepti Singh: like i don't think its a calculation error
04/12/2021, 12:57 - Sandeepti Singh: which means my method is wrong
04/12/2021, 12:57 - Sandeepti Singh: but that's the only method i can think of
04/12/2021, 12:58 - Tara: no but
04/12/2021, 12:58 - Tara: this is the only way to do it

10/12/2021, 18:17 - Sandeepti Singh: The dramaaa
10/12/2021, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: It seems like I’m watching an Oscar winning film on Russia?
10/12/2021, 18:18 - Tara: Hahaha
10/12/2021, 18:18 - Tara: Well most of it would have to take place in cathedrals
10/12/2021, 18:18 - Tara: Why are there so many in Russia
10/12/2021, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: No clue lol
10/12/2021, 18:19 - Tara: I hated Russia because every single day we would visit 2-3 cathedrals
10/12/2021, 18:19 - Tara: I would honestly rather die than step into another stupid cathedral
10/12/2021, 18:20 - Tara: And also because taxi drivers kept trying to scam us but that's secondary
10/12/2021, 18:20 - Tara: Oops I almost messaged Sarthak "I hate Russia"
10/12/2021, 18:31 - Tara: <Media omitted>

10/12/2021, 19:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hellloooo
10/12/2021, 19:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Can I have help with a physics question
10/12/2021, 19:45 - Tara: Good evening how may i help you
10/12/2021, 19:45 - Tara: ok
10/12/2021, 19:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Can’t ask vignesh lol

10/12/2021, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh wait
10/12/2021, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I know
10/12/2021, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Is it that it had half phase change twice so it’s actually in phase now?
10/12/2021, 19:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Darn it I hate phase change stuff in IB too
10/12/2021, 19:48 - Tara: the question does say constructive
10/12/2021, 19:49 - Tara: wait lemme reread one sec
10/12/2021, 19:49 - Tara: i think so?
10/12/2021, 19:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay?
10/12/2021, 19:49 - Tara: like it goes in -> phase shift
goes out -> phase out?
10/12/2021, 19:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I vaguely remember my IB physics teacher talking about it
10/12/2021, 19:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks lol
10/12/2021, 19:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Talking to u I solve my own problems
10/12/2021, 19:50 - Tara: oui

10/12/2021, 20:52 - Tara: ok?
10/12/2021, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: I kinda agree with u that the final past paper I practice felt much easier than the midterm one

10/12/2021, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
10/12/2021, 20:53 - Tara: yeah it might just have been because i hate e&m
10/12/2021, 20:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Same. Also the diffraction stuff was from physics ib  so it seems a teeny bit easier
10/12/2021, 21:00 - Tara: hello wife said you cannot marry us
10/12/2021, 21:00 - Tara: oh nvm she said jk

10/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: yes but you focus on physics
10/12/2021, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: last one was 70%
10/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: don't worry about her for now

11/12/2021, 12:16 - Tara: Maybe even chatty
Who knows
11/12/2021, 15:12 - Tara: I bet Evelyn knows Monique through her father
11/12/2021, 15:12 - Tara: That's the only way
11/12/2021, 15:12 - Tara: And her true love ain't one of the husband's
11/12/2021, 15:14 - Tara: Also how did the exam go
11/12/2021, 15:30 - Tara: You deleted this message
11/12/2021, 15:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh you’re reading 7 husbands of Evelyn Hugo
11/12/2021, 15:55 - Sandeepti Singh: I love Evelyn’s characters but really hated whenever the reporter person was there lol

12/12/2021, 21:53 - Tara: 🥲 I remember not being able to do this question either I'm sorry
12/12/2021, 21:53 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhahah
12/12/2021, 21:54 - Tara: I apologise
12/12/2021, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: nah nw
12/12/2021, 21:54 - Tara: Is Sid free to help
12/12/2021, 21:54 - Tara: He'll definitely know the answer
12/12/2021, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: he has final and report so i didn't wanna bother him
12/12/2021, 21:55 - Tara: Girl your final is tomorrow
I think this is a tiny bit more important
12/12/2021, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: it's cool i'll ask hansika/vignesh
12/12/2021, 21:55 - Tara: Ok fair enough
12/12/2021, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: 🥲
12/12/2021, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: still in denial about that
12/12/2021, 22:01 - Tara: Hey you'll crush it
12/12/2021, 22:29 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
12/12/2021, 22:29 - Sandeepti Singh: like shenme
12/12/2021, 22:29 - Sandeepti Singh: am i missing somethig super obvious
12/12/2021, 22:38 - Tara: Is it an array?
12/12/2021, 22:38 - Tara: Hmm
12/12/2021, 22:38 - Tara: Don't tell me it's a function name
12/12/2021, 22:39 - Tara: Ok one second
12/12/2021, 22:39 - Sandeepti Singh: nope it's okay it's soemthing called lambda expression which they taught for like  line
12/12/2021, 22:39 - Tara: Aha I was just gonna say that
12/12/2021, 22:40 - Tara: I found some examples on stack overflow
12/12/2021, 22:40 - Tara: Nice
12/12/2021, 22:40 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhh shit i checked pizza and it;s not in our syllabus anymore
12/12/2021, 22:40 - Tara: Mhm we didn't learn it either
12/12/2021, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: apparently they mentioned it very breidly
12/12/2021, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: but like not really
12/12/2021, 22:41 - Tara: Again they had like one slide dedicated to it
12/12/2021, 22:41 - Tara: Ja
12/12/2021, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
13/12/2021, 08:46 - Tara: Good luck
13/12/2021, 09:02 - Tara: You deleted this message
13/12/2021, 09:02 - Tara: You deleted this message
13/12/2021, 09:08 - Tara: Halp Siyoon ditched
13/12/2021, 11:25 - Tara: Lol ok so the not Korean guy is here
13/12/2021, 11:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Wya?
13/12/2021, 21:02 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
13/12/2021, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Any ideas?
13/12/2021, 21:24 - Tara: hmm sorry i dunno why
13/12/2021, 21:24 - Tara: i would just use gs
13/12/2021, 21:25 - Tara: that is a nifty formula though
13/12/2021, 21:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh so otherwise I’d have to take v1 and then use gs to find v2 and then normalise it
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Tara: oui
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh okay
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Tara: im doing some research
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Danke
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: On?
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Tara: remember the question i asked the ohers about
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Tara: the equation
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: No
13/12/2021, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh thanks
13/12/2021, 21:28 - Tara: oh im mistaken
13/12/2021, 21:28 - Tara: the gs thing
13/12/2021, 21:28 - Tara: would it work if you dont know v
13/12/2021, 21:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno
13/12/2021, 21:29 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s why they used that formals I guess but I’m not sure
13/12/2021, 21:29 - Tara: http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/417/OrthoProj.pdf
?
13/12/2021, 21:30 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
13/12/2021, 21:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhhh yeah we can use either way but I guess the formula combines the steps
13/12/2021, 21:30 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s faster
13/12/2021, 21:31 - Tara: yeah
13/12/2021, 21:31 - Tara: well it's a handy formula
13/12/2021, 21:31 - Sandeepti Singh: But I think for the exam I might just be safe and use the gs cuz that’s what they taught
13/12/2021, 21:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro I’m so excited for tmr after 3:30 cuz I’ll be done with finals
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Not looking for the grades to come out though 🥲🤡
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: im excited for you too
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also sid is coming for bafang too
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: If that’s okay
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: good
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: yeah yeah
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: siyoon too
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: I mean I guess u can’t say no hahah
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: efje and yuen yin idk
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Okie is efje done with finals after tmrv
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Tara: n o
13/12/2021, 21:32 - Sandeepti Singh: What about yin
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Tara: gnop
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea then they most probably won’t
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Tara: sid knows about siyoon's comp final
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Tara: we spent like ten minutes saying dw you'll probably get an f
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Tara: the afternoon was fun we hung out in ifc and ate ice cream
13/12/2021, 21:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah def cuz the course requires u to get at least like 14% on final
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Tara: have you tried the godiva ice cream
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh niceee
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t think I have but tbh I probably have lol
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Tara: great let's get you some
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Haha okay
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Tara: everyone gets ice cream!
13/12/2021, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Insert Oprah meme
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: yes!!
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I still haven’t done the past papers so wish me luck
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: And good bye
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: wot
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: bye
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: no talky
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: i see you at 3:45
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I was going through all textbook questions first
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Tara: i will now ignore you
merilyn is teaching me medicine
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz that def helps (I mean I did them once so I was just looking at my notes on them)
13/12/2021, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay hahah bye
13/12/2021, 21:36 - Tara: ofc
13/12/2021, 22:16 - Tara: Oh dude I would like my maths textbook back after the exam thanks
13/12/2021, 22:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup sure
13/12/2021, 22:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Do u want me to bring it tmr?
13/12/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Also help
13/12/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
13/12/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Ik zero determinant means the columns have to be dependent
13/12/2021, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: But not sure how🥲
13/12/2021, 23:05 - Tara: yes pls
13/12/2021, 23:07 - Tara: ok so you have
13/12/2021, 23:07 - Tara: v1-v2
v2-v3
v3-v1
linearly dependent means c1v1+c2v2+c3v3=0
13/12/2021, 23:08 - Tara: c1!=0,c2!=0,c3!=0
13/12/2021, 23:08 - Tara: but if you do (v1-v2)+(v2-v3)+(v3-v1)=0
13/12/2021, 23:08 - Tara: which means they're linearly dependent
13/12/2021, 23:08 - Tara: so determinant is 0
13/12/2021, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhhh damn
13/12/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: one more question?
13/12/2021, 23:09 - Tara: shoot
13/12/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: sorry i just hate conceptual questions and can't understand them
13/12/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
13/12/2021, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: 5
13/12/2021, 23:13 - Tara: k so being a subspace of M3*3 means it needs to be closed under addition and scalar multiplications
13/12/2021, 23:14 - Tara: you know what closed means right
13/12/2021, 23:14 - Tara: if a and b are in S then a+b should be in S and xa+yb should be in S
13/12/2021, 23:14 - Tara: like that
13/12/2021, 23:14 - Tara: anyway
13/12/2021, 23:14 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
13/12/2021, 23:15 - Tara: NullA contains e1 means Ae1 = 0
13/12/2021, 23:15 - Tara: Say you have A=0
then Ae1 = 0e1 = 0 which is in M
13/12/2021, 23:15 - Tara: Then let A1, A2 be in M
So A1e1 = A2e2 = 0
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: A1e1+A2e2=0+0=0
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: oh sorry
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: (A1+A2)e1=A1e1+A2e2=0+0=0
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: which is in M
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: if you multiply it by a scalar x then xAe1=0 as well
13/12/2021, 23:16 - Tara: so it's closed
13/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: that's just a lol
13/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: b
|A|=0
Say you have two matrices A and B with |A|=|B|=0
13/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: However if you take |A+B| it's not 0
13/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: idk i cant think of an example
13/12/2021, 23:18 - Tara: this be hypothetical
13/12/2021, 23:18 - Tara: not closed -> not subspace
13/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: c
Take for example ATA=I and BTB=I
13/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: Then (A+B)T(A+B)
13/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: If you expand it what do you get
13/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: it shouldn't be I I think
13/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: so not a subspace
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh i knew about it being closed but the questions make it so much harder
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Sandeepti Singh: 😾
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Sandeepti Singh: but thanks so much
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Sandeepti Singh: heart stickers
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Tara: d
Idk
13/12/2021, 23:20 - Tara: I think
13/12/2021, 23:21 - Tara: What happens when you sum two diagonalised matrices
13/12/2021, 23:21 - Tara: is it still diagonalised
13/12/2021, 23:21 - Tara: eh there's only one correct answer so it must be no
13/12/2021, 23:21 - Tara: lmao at my effort in solving it decreasing
13/12/2021, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: ahaha
13/12/2021, 23:24 - Tara: any more questions or
13/12/2021, 23:24 - Tara: if so imma reply in the morning because i sleepy
13/12/2021, 23:24 - Tara: break a leg

13/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: you will do well
13/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: and then we will celebrate
13/12/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks but i doubt it but it's fine
13/12/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i have lowkey given up this sem
13/12/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll make it up next sem

13/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: same

13/12/2021, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll wake up and do questions
13/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: oui
14/12/2021, 10:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Yo
14/12/2021, 10:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Meet at sb after 3:30?
14/12/2021, 11:30 - Tara: Ya
14/12/2021, 15:46 - Tara: How did it go

14/12/2021, 21:12 - Tara: k so i just forgot
14/12/2021, 21:12 - Tara: i slept for nearly 12 hours
14/12/2021, 21:12 - Tara: because the night before i slept at 5am
14/12/2021, 21:12 - Tara: 5-8
14/12/2021, 21:13 - Tara: remembered*
14/12/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Brooo
14/12/2021, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: That might be me tonight hahah
14/12/2021, 23:39 - Tara: enjoy
15/12/2021, 11:49 - Tara: Hunter B-15 really had the best character arc lmao
15/12/2021, 11:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Where’s that from????
15/12/2021, 11:49 - Sandeepti Singh: I can’t remember lol
15/12/2021, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Also bro comp mean for final was 48 🥲
15/12/2021, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Like usually it’s 60
15/12/2021, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Dropped that much
15/12/2021, 11:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Also I also slept for 10 hours last night lol
15/12/2021, 12:00 - Tara: Loki
15/12/2021, 12:00 - Tara: Went from hating them to letting them escape
15/12/2021, 12:01 - Tara: Dw ours was that low too
15/12/2021, 12:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg yes I loved that arc
15/12/2021, 12:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh you know that show I recommended called she-ra
15/12/2021, 12:04 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s whole premise is sorta like hunter b15 thing
15/12/2021, 12:08 - Tara: Nice
15/12/2021, 12:08 - Tara: Gonna watch the great first
15/12/2021, 12:08 - Tara: It looks hilarious
15/12/2021, 12:49 - Sandeepti Singh: It is I love it hahah
15/12/2021, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I have a question
15/12/2021, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: You know for comp the means they send in emails are always higher than the ones on canvas
15/12/2021, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I think they remove 0s or something right
15/12/2021, 12:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Which one do they actually use for final grades
15/12/2021, 12:52 - Tara: Ohh no wonder
15/12/2021, 12:52 - Tara: Up until now I never thought people wouldn't show up for the exam
15/12/2021, 12:53 - Tara: Also I'm not sure sorry
15/12/2021, 12:53 - Tara: But there can't be that much of a deviation right
15/12/2021, 12:53 - Tara: There are loads of people taking it
15/12/2021, 12:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah true lol
15/12/2021, 12:54 - Sandeepti Singh: But I guess if final scores are based on all scores for everyone then I guess 0s are inherently included
15/12/2021, 12:54 - Tara: Mm yeah
15/12/2021, 18:52 - Tara: i need memorable quotes from you
15/12/2021, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: I have never said anything memorable 🥲

19/12/2021, 11:24 - Sandeepti Singh: HAhaha yes
19/12/2021, 11:27 - Tara: There was some Day at West Island which I had to go to
And I guess I did but it's not important
Then I was in Fusion and I was looking for potatos and cheese and onions because I wanted to bake a potato in Fusion and eat it
I had all the ingredients besides the cheese so before I found said cheese I was looking at tutorials to see how to bake a potato but all I could find was how to make those thick potato chips
Anyway I went to find the cheese and I found two types
First was good
Second tasted terrible 
But I took them both anyway because Cheese
Then as I was leaving I saw a bunch of aunties who I didn't want to talk to so I legitimately hid behind some tomatoes until they left
19/12/2021, 11:27 - Tara: Fusion had ovens ok
19/12/2021, 11:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah not the Indian aunties
19/12/2021, 11:28 - Tara: There was an aunty I really hate because she's so goddamn loud
19/12/2021, 11:28 - Sandeepti Singh: But I would, in real life, also choose to hide behind tomatoes rather than talk to Bren
19/12/2021, 11:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Then
19/12/2021, 11:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Them

23/12/2021, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: And if it actually Is then it’ll just complicate stuff needlessly
23/12/2021, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Even if it’s siyoon it won’t work out anyways

23/12/2021, 22:42 - Tara: No we cannot
23/12/2021, 22:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro my cgpa dropped by like .4
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: Mine by 0.2
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: Ha
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: You know the funniest thing
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: On paper comp4971 and elec2600h are supposed to be the mosg difficult courses in my pathway
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: But I did the best in them?
23/12/2021, 22:43 - Tara: Like what happened

23/12/2021, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Mine fell by like 0.2 something
23/12/2021, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: How was comp 4971?
23/12/2021, 22:45 - Tara: A
23/12/2021, 22:45 - Tara: So there's a course from Vanderbilt (beginner) and hkust (intermediate)
23/12/2021, 22:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Damn nicer
23/12/2021, 22:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Niceee
23/12/2021, 22:45 - Tara: The intermediate one would be better maybe because we both know linear algebra and calculus
But then again differential equations?
23/12/2021, 22:46 - Tara: Or we could just do both
23/12/2021, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Let’s do both

23/12/2021, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh let’s ask siyoon for slides to 1200 too and go over them
23/12/2021, 22:47 - Tara: Shit but the Vanderbilt one is a specialisation

23/12/2021, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
23/12/2021, 22:47 - Tara: The HKUST one would be more relevant

25/12/2021, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: He too rich lol
25/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: You're gonna be mad at me
25/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: Finished the manhua
25/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: It tugged at the heartstrings
25/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: But
25/12/2021, 23:17 - Tara: No tears
25/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: It's sad
Really sad
25/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: How did their relationship get so bad
25/12/2021, 23:19 - Tara: Jiang wenxuan lol I forgot his name was awful
25/12/2021, 23:20 - Tara: But also he didn't even get to see he zhishu when he died
25/12/2021, 23:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah It’s okay I’m not mad
25/12/2021, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: After u not crying at banana fish I kinda expected this
25/12/2021, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: But this is def sadder than bf
25/12/2021, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Ikr. For me that was probably the saddest part. Even on my second read the part that hurts most is like the contrast between the past relationship and the present relationship
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: But was it a good read in general?
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Tara: Yes
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Tara: I don't think I'm going to read it again though
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Did u read the letter at the end?
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Tara: Yes I did
25/12/2021, 23:22 - Tara: Ugh the problem is
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Tara: When people write things like that I feel bad for them
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Tara: Even though they're objectively a bad person
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Exactly okay
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Like that letter made me feel so bad for the dumb husband
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Sandeepti Singh: When the whole way through I just hated him
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Tara: Yeah
25/12/2021, 23:23 - Tara: I hate him
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Tara: Why did they have to portray him in an okay light
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: But then also main dude’s last words were after school let’s go home together
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Tara: Stop being so complex
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Like at the end he still thought of the bust and
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Guns and
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Husband
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol sorry
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yeah
25/12/2021, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: But does this mean I can recommend u more mangas 👉👈
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: Yes
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg yay
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: Oh you bastard now I have to rethink
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: Ffs
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
25/12/2021, 23:25 - Tara: I need to think objectively
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: I hate the husband
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: No matter what he does or say
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: He's an emotional manipulator
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: Who should be thrown into jail
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah bro he raped his husband
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Made him cut of ties with his friends
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: Main dude has no thingy to talk to him
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: Obligation
25/12/2021, 23:26 - Tara: Now excuse me I need to block someone
25/12/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Like the husband was sleeping around and had the audacity to tell main dude to not see the “friend”
25/12/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha what??? Who??? Why???
25/12/2021, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: https://www.mangago.me/read-manga/koimonogatari/

25/12/2021, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Who though HHaha
25/12/2021, 23:29 - Tara: What's it about
25/12/2021, 23:29 - Tara: Oh hullo this one's shorter
25/12/2021, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: this guy thinks this other guy is gay and in love with his best friend
25/12/2021, 23:29 - Tara: This morning an unsavoury character wished me merry Christmas and I was conflicted on whether I should respond
25/12/2021, 23:30 - Tara: In the end I blocked her
25/12/2021, 23:30 - Tara: Wait I think you showed me some panels
25/12/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: starts off werid cuz the main dude isn't sure what to think of the gay dude cuz he's not really met any non-straight people
25/12/2021, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: but it's so pure after that. like it's the best friendship and kindness and all that
25/12/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: idk the story is occaisonally cliche but i love the character relationships
25/12/2021, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: oh def good decision
25/12/2021, 23:31 - Tara: So he things gay dude is in love with gay dudes bff?

01/01/2022, 22:01 - Tara: when we trust him
01/01/2022, 22:01 - Tara: and are like 99% supportive
01/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: uh
01/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: do you want screenshots
01/01/2022, 22:02 - Tara: yeah that would be better
01/01/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea I didn’t used to think he was but umm yea he absolutely is
01/01/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea and the worst part is he’ll basically make u feel like the one in the wrong
01/01/2022, 22:03 - Tara: some stuff is really harsh
01/01/2022, 22:03 - Tara: and uh a lot of speculating
01/01/2022, 22:04 - Tara: so make of it what you will
01/01/2022, 22:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh send now I’m curious

01/01/2022, 22:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/01/2022, 22:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/01/2022, 22:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>

01/01/2022, 22:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/01/2022, 22:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol legit everything thing y’all said is so accurate

01/01/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: This is the whole reason I wanted to be subtle cuz it could go tits up
01/01/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: And then he had to go out of his way to make it so obvious
01/01/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: The thing is he kept trying to hold my hand
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Sandeepti Singh: So I kept feeling bad
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Tara: yeah
once he said once he starts a habit he waits 3 months til it becomes an actual habit
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Tara: i mean dating isnt a habit obviously
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I tried so hard to go up and hold Prisha’s or simran’s hand or soemthing
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Tara: but you know what i mean right
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Tara: like you would expect him to wait a bit before telling everyone
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Tara: now he has to tell those same people that it didnt work out
01/01/2022, 22:14 - Sandeepti Singh: But he kept trying to hold it so I felt bad and had to give I’m basically
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Exactly fml
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Tara: i really wish he'll be objective
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Fuck
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Tara: like if he has to tell people it didn't work out
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
01/01/2022, 22:15 - Tara: lmao did you just delete all your messages with him
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Tara: are you gonna tell him to wait again
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Ye lol it was annoying me
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Should I break up over text lol
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Tara: time to clean that slate
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Tara: no
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Tara: please
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: I didn’t want to but he’s asking me again
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Tara: just archive his chat
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: See I told him to wait and talk it out on Monday
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: And he still texted again
01/01/2022, 22:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Now what am I supposed to do
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Tara: tell him to wait lah
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Tara: if he annoys you again
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I either lie or tell him to wait till Monday which is just a confirmation
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Tara: break up
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Tara: two time rule
01/01/2022, 22:17 - Tara: yeah

01/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Or gets salty about the breakup
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: yeah
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Because before we even started I said like 3 separate times that if it goes bad then no making a big deal
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: i know we jokingly cancel him
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: but if this becomes the case
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: touch wood
01/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: then he's actually dead
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I am gonna hope it doesn’t
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: he will be uninvited from birthday
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh damn that’s serious
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: yeah exactly
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: i mean it sounds so trivial doesnt it
01/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: but hahahah
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: so serious
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: anyway
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: no i'll think about it
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: i will threaten him
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: if he tells us you ended things
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah I was legit talking about how he shouldn’t apologise so often cuz I rarely get mad. Like it’s legit very difficult to make me actually mad
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: literally going to use it as leverage
01/01/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: But I almost went off in him today at McDonald’s
01/01/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s why I said we’ll talk about it later
01/01/2022, 22:21 - Tara: it was surprising
01/01/2022, 22:21 - Tara: and a bit scary
01/01/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz if I hadnm5 I would have legit gone off
01/01/2022, 22:21 - Tara: oh

01/01/2022, 22:23 - Sandeepti Singh: This is worst case scenario lmao
01/01/2022, 22:23 - Sandeepti Singh: The fact that I actually may have liked him and he legit made me unlike him lmao

01/01/2022, 22:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh makes sense haha
01/01/2022, 22:27 - Tara: like just that he gives off the impression
01/01/2022, 22:27 - Tara: that he's micromanaging
01/01/2022, 22:27 - Tara: omg perfect word
01/01/2022, 22:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh wow get u an aspiring lit major to phrase your thoughts into coherent insults

03/01/2022, 09:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Did not know that
03/01/2022, 09:22 - Tara: For graphing and stuff
03/01/2022, 09:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Probably could have looked it up
03/01/2022, 09:22 - Tara: Yeah
03/01/2022, 09:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Also how we doing it? Like together
03/01/2022, 09:22 - Tara: I guess we could just start the online course and power through it at our own pace
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Tara: Start date: today
End date: 31st Jan
How's that
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll check out the online course after my isom
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Sandeepti Singh: I might stick around and work with siyoon
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Tara: Ok
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Tara: Enjoy isom
03/01/2022, 09:23 - Sandeepti Singh: After the breaking up lmao
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Affirmation: I will not sleep
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro I legit got 2 hours of sleep last night
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Tara: ....during lecture or the breakup
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Tara: Why
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Tara: Movie?
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Like i went to bed super early (umm 2) but couldn’t fall asleep for some reason
03/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Both lmao
03/01/2022, 09:25 - Tara: Reasons aside the fact that you two were official for about a week is really funny
03/01/2022, 09:25 - Tara: Aw man that sucks
03/01/2022, 09:26 - Tara: A very short rollercoaster
03/01/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah maybe cuz I had like two servings of tiramisu right before bed
03/01/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Forgetting it had black coffee in it
03/01/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Something I’ve cut out of my diet and lost all tolerance for
03/01/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol
03/01/2022, 09:27 - Tara: Oh less than a week nvm
03/01/2022, 09:27 - Tara: Ma'am you need to include this so I don't feel bad for you
03/01/2022, 09:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah I was in the process of typing
03/01/2022, 09:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Also u can still feel bad for my sleep deprived ass who has 3+ hours of lecture and then the scheduled breakup
03/01/2022, 09:28 - Tara: True
03/01/2022, 09:28 - Tara: I hope you survive
03/01/2022, 09:29 - Tara: Well if you're really too tired to start MATLAB then we can start tomorrow
03/01/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Affirmation: survive
03/01/2022, 09:31 - Tara: Manifesting it rn ✨✨
03/01/2022, 09:35 - Tara: Oh Jesus you end at 1?
03/01/2022, 09:35 - Tara: Awful
03/01/2022, 09:35 - Tara: Ok talk to you then
03/01/2022, 09:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Shit bro I think cpeg is not allowed to take elec 2600H
03/01/2022, 09:51 - Tara: Oh how come
03/01/2022, 09:52 - Tara: H apparently isn't available during spring
03/01/2022, 09:54 - Tara: But if elec2600 is an alternative to 2711 then shouldn't H also be one
03/01/2022, 09:54 - Tara: You should ask
03/01/2022, 09:55 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
03/01/2022, 09:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Like here they put 2711H but not 2600H
03/01/2022, 09:55 - Sandeepti Singh: So I was wondering
03/01/2022, 09:55 - Tara: True but there's not much difference between 2600 and H
03/01/2022, 09:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea that’s why I was confused
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Sandeepti Singh: I told Vinayak so he’ll do research lol
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Sandeepti Singh: I was more inclined to 2600 anyways
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Also you can't even take H next sem it's not offered then
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Ugh sorry I didn't realise it's only offered in fall
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I know
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Sandeepti Singh: I knew cuz sid always mentions that
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Sandeepti Singh: But also
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Whoops
03/01/2022, 09:56 - Tara: Yeah that's cool
03/01/2022, 09:57 - Tara: How's the lecture
03/01/2022, 09:57 - Tara: Interesting stuff lmao
03/01/2022, 10:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I still don’t get the difference between 2600 and 2600H though
03/01/2022, 10:21 - Tara: Content is pretty much the same
H goes at a faster pace
I think there's like a few advanced concepts we cover but you'll just have to check the syllabus for that
H has better grading
03/01/2022, 10:25 - Tara: Exam papers are basically exactly like the homework
03/01/2022, 10:25 - Tara: H has like two extra questions in the homework
03/01/2022, 10:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay I guess I might do 1200 and 2400 next sem and so elec 2600H in fall
03/01/2022, 10:26 - Sandeepti Singh: But like after I email cpeg to check if H is acceptable
03/01/2022, 10:40 - Tara: Okay
03/01/2022, 10:42 - Tara: I'll take those too and maybe a maths and comp course
03/01/2022, 10:45 - Tara: Oh and elec2350
03/01/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Oohh
03/01/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanna keep course load light so I’ll do those two and then Lang2030H and then huma
03/01/2022, 10:46 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I’m not gonna do minor now lol
03/01/2022, 10:46 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll just chill and do 14/15 credits each sem plus exchange
03/01/2022, 10:50 - Tara: Lmao I was looking at a review and someone gave it all Es but they basically just said they fucked around and didn't do anything and got a C in the end
03/01/2022, 10:50 - Tara: Jealous
How are you doing this
03/01/2022, 10:50 - Tara: I guess transfer credits takes some stress off
03/01/2022, 10:51 - Tara: But h o w
03/01/2022, 10:51 - Tara: Oh
03/01/2022, 10:51 - Tara: Minor
03/01/2022, 10:51 - Tara: I forgot
03/01/2022, 10:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah without minor and with transfer credits it’s doable
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: But I think last semester I will have 17/18 credits but I don’t need to care about scholarship so idc bahah
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Tara: 🥲 none of the BDT courses cross over with ELEC
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Tara: Sadness
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao then the review should be As
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Bdt?
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Tara: Yeah or just not even review like bro your review is so useless
03/01/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Ikr
03/01/2022, 10:53 - Tara: It's not helpful it's just you saying you didn't work
03/01/2022, 10:53 - Tara: Big data
03/01/2022, 10:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
03/01/2022, 10:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea basically for me I either go exchange or minor
03/01/2022, 10:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Ceebs to do more credits Sam
03/01/2022, 10:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Sem
03/01/2022, 10:56 - Tara: Ok fair enough
03/01/2022, 10:57 - Tara: I'm happy to forgo the semester abroad
03/01/2022, 10:57 - Sandeepti Singh: And I am happy to forgo minor lol
03/01/2022, 10:58 - Tara: Parents are forcing me to try transfering to cpeg instead of maths
If I do maths then I'd have so much time to do stuff smh
03/01/2022, 10:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
03/01/2022, 10:59 - Sandeepti Singh: My dad was like take it chill and that I don’t have to do minor cuz I wanna do masters anyways
03/01/2022, 11:00 - Sandeepti Singh: But tbh I was look at business Minor and I need 15 creds and legit I can compete that over summer/winter
03/01/2022, 11:00 - Sandeepti Singh: So I might do that if I feel like it
03/01/2022, 11:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Like if I don’t get a good interjship over y2 summer I’ll just do like 2/3 courses and 1 course over winter
03/01/2022, 11:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Then I could just do 1/2 extra courses and get the minor
03/01/2022, 11:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Can’t u do soemthing like summer and winter thing?
03/01/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Yep that's my goal
03/01/2022, 11:24 - Tara: The winter internship wasn't
03/01/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Exactly part of the plan lmao
03/01/2022, 11:25 - Tara: A nice addition
03/01/2022, 11:25 - Tara: But unexpected
03/01/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA did u just not get into the courses u wanted to?
03/01/2022, 11:38 - Tara: no i applied for a bunch before i applied for winter courses
03/01/2022, 11:38 - Tara: the courses were a backup because i dont want to be lazy
03/01/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
03/01/2022, 13:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey
03/01/2022, 13:20 - Sandeepti Singh: So I’m done breaking up lol
03/01/2022, 13:21 - Sandeepti Singh: It took like 30 seconds
03/01/2022, 13:21 - Sandeepti Singh: And he didn’t cry
03/01/2022, 13:21 - Sandeepti Singh: He just seemed sad
03/01/2022, 13:22 - Sandeepti Singh: But like just super fast
03/01/2022, 13:52 - Tara: Yay nice
03/01/2022, 13:52 - Tara: Did you just say you wanna break up and just left lmao
03/01/2022, 13:53 - Tara: Also how was isom
03/01/2022, 14:08 - Sandeepti Singh: That is exactly what happened
03/01/2022, 14:13 - Tara: Well damn
03/01/2022, 14:13 - Tara: Good for you
03/01/2022, 14:13 - Tara: Well at least you didn't have to explain yourself
He definitely knew why
03/01/2022, 14:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I explained a bit
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Like literally 5 seconds
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Tara: Ephicient
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Sandeepti Singh: And I mentioned that I wasn’t gonna change my mind about it
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Sandeepti Singh: And that we only went out once and that we were always aware that if anything went wrong we go back to being friends
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao I legit have him a thumbs up at one point hahaha
03/01/2022, 14:20 - Tara: Ma'am??
03/01/2022, 14:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I’m at karaoke now
03/01/2022, 14:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/01/2022, 14:22 - Tara: Oh man I need to think of a response for when he breaks the news
03/01/2022, 14:22 - Tara: "Omg no"
03/01/2022, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha no don’t do that
03/01/2022, 14:32 - Tara: Ofc not
03/01/2022, 14:32 - Tara: I'll feel bad
03/01/2022, 14:36 - Tara: I'll just say that I'm sorry that happened and leave it at that
03/01/2022, 14:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahh okay
03/01/2022, 17:35 - Tara: Cry
Kathy's leaving
03/01/2022, 17:37 - Tara: Idek why I'm sad
I barely knew her
03/01/2022, 17:37 - Tara: But she seemed so nice
03/01/2022, 17:37 - Tara: She's like the Mom of the group
03/01/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg same
03/01/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: I only talked to her a few times but she was so niceee
03/01/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: 🥲
03/01/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Also I got my room number and stuff 😬
03/01/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Who do we know from hall 6?
03/01/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Also can we cook together more often instead of eating out every night once I move to hall
03/01/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Efje liked the idea
03/01/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: And wanted to partake
03/01/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Also what’s up with Sid? Did he tell y’all anything yet!
03/01/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: ?*

03/01/2022, 18:53 - Tara: Nope
03/01/2022, 18:53 - Tara: Hasn't said a thing
03/01/2022, 18:53 - Tara: Ikemura
03/01/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh can u check if he’s okay though
03/01/2022, 18:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yes I will force u guys to cook (for me) /s
03/01/2022, 18:54 - Sandeepti Singh: I do wanna learn how to cook
03/01/2022, 18:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Imagine if I exchange to somewhere without y’all
03/01/2022, 18:57 - Tara: You've told Efje right because I'm gonna ask on three cheese
03/01/2022, 18:58 - Tara: You will
Dw you'll be forced to learn
03/01/2022, 18:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup she knows
03/01/2022, 19:45 - Tara: Gonna start MATLAB
03/01/2022, 19:45 - Tara: Which course shall we do
03/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: oh nice we can use vscode for it
03/01/2022, 20:01 - Tara: https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-response-program-for-hkust-lwwxu/browse?authProvider=hkust&productId=5VdkGjEiEeqIPQqRfoc3XQ&productType=course&query=MATLAB&showMiniModal=true
It's UST but I don't think it's particularly relevant to ELEC
03/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: i think we should do the vanderbilt one because there's n entire course on signals
03/01/2022, 20:29 - Tara: ok step one: figure out how to install matlab
03/01/2022, 20:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Bad news I’m too tired to do anything rn cuz I legit didn’t sleep yesterday

03/01/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Isom was boring
03/01/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Karaoke was fun
03/01/2022, 20:40 - Tara: 7 so early lah
03/01/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: The number of songs I remember the lyrics to astonished even me
03/01/2022, 20:41 - Sandeepti Singh: 7 year old song? No problem I remember it word for word
03/01/2022, 20:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Where is this memory during exams hahah
03/01/2022, 20:41 - Tara: hahaha
03/01/2022, 20:41 - Tara: selective memory
03/01/2022, 20:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I can’t tell if ur being sarcastic 🥲

03/01/2022, 20:46 - Tara: I have a routine now I guess
03/01/2022, 20:47 - Tara: Are you excited to move in
03/01/2022, 20:47 - Tara: Oh shoot I need to pay my fees

03/01/2022, 20:48 - Tara: That's fine
03/01/2022, 21:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg yes
03/01/2022, 21:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I am gonna try and cook something tmr
03/01/2022, 21:05 - Sandeepti Singh: As practice
03/01/2022, 21:06 - Tara: Housewarming dinner at your place /s
03/01/2022, 21:07 - Tara: Hahaha treat us at lohas while you still have your parents etc then we trudge over to hall /S
03/01/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah but actually though I will force ebeyone to cook like 3 times a week
03/01/2022, 21:07 - Tara: Like big sarcasm
Terrible suggestion
03/01/2022, 21:07 - Tara: Like the UST folks?
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Tara: Pretty sure Efje and Sid are the only ones who cook
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha makes it sound like my parents are gonna die
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Tara: Yes it did sound morbid sorry
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Tara: It's better to be prepared than not
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah. Efje said she wants to cook more often too but it feels sad to cook alone and spend all that time on it to just eat it in 10 min
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: So if we do it together she’ll wanna cook
03/01/2022, 21:08 - Tara: Ah yes motivation
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: Hey a new years resolution
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: Cook more
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: And ma’am what are your cooking skills
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: Nonexistent
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I can def cook basic breakfast stuff
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: I've been very clear about that
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: I can follow recipes
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Tara: But I wouldn't say I have a skill
03/01/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Wow I apologise I once again assumed (incorrectly) that U were competent
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s my plan too though lol
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Oh
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Sid does NOT cook well
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Then I do have some? Except I just don't cook
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: What was that noodles at his place
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Like the skill is there but the experience is not
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m gonna make u. You can’t eat out everyday
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Ok

03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: I buy utensils
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s a nice evening break that u would have taken anyways
03/01/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Parents are gonna be like it's a waste of time
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: But what do they know /s
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHAHA again it’s a break u would have taken anyways
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: I'll buy stuff soon
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: And like an hour for dinner is not outrageous
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Aw man Sid is typing
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Like he's already sent 10 messages I think
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Yes
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Tara: True
03/01/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh what for

03/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Hahaha did you just forget
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: That you broke up with him
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Like how could he have 10 messages+ worth of stuff
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: It could also be Efje messaging
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: But I don't have the energy to read anything
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh right she was also very in favour of breakup lol
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Tara: As she should
03/01/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Exactly
03/01/2022, 21:13 - Tara: One second brb
03/01/2022, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay
03/01/2022, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m curious 👉👈 but it also feels like a violation of some doctor patient confidentiality lol
03/01/2022, 21:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Wow I actually made a schedule for tmr I’m so proud of me
03/01/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll be prouder if I actually follow through haha
03/01/2022, 21:17 - Tara: What's the schedule
03/01/2022, 21:17 - Tara: I'll give you a tldr
03/01/2022, 21:17 - Tara: I'm just thinking now that my god (ok this is gonna sound like he's a serial killer but) how he would have treated the other girls had they accepted smh
03/01/2022, 21:17 - Tara: I mean it's not _awful_ ya know
03/01/2022, 21:18 - Tara: But still pretty shit
03/01/2022, 21:18 - Tara: You deleted this message
03/01/2022, 21:19 - Tara: I believe in you
03/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: If Efje for any reason tells Sid that she wished she chose him imma smack her
03/01/2022, 21:25 - Tara: well wish me luck im going to read the whatever now
03/01/2022, 21:26 - Tara: eh k there's just some moping around which is understandable
03/01/2022, 21:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh? That’s random lol
03/01/2022, 21:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Good luck? Too late lol

03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: no? idk
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: lemme tell you
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: because I feel like jt could have worked if we were more upfront with each other about how we felt
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: i dont like this
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: because youve been pretty open with him
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: you told him he was too much
03/01/2022, 21:28 - Tara: he did _not_ listen
03/01/2022, 21:29 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/01/2022, 21:29 - Tara: efje told him not to delve into self-pity
03/01/2022, 21:30 - Tara: and to move on
03/01/2022, 21:30 - Tara: we stan
03/01/2022, 21:32 - Tara: would it be bad if i said bad mouthing will not be tolerated
03/01/2022, 21:32 - Tara: yeah
03/01/2022, 21:32 - Tara: it would
03/01/2022, 21:33 - Tara: well he seems fine
03/01/2022, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh I said he was too much so many fucking times
03/01/2022, 21:34 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanna whoop his ass
03/01/2022, 21:34 - Tara: egg-hecking-zactly
03/01/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm not even low-key mad I’m high key mad
03/01/2022, 21:36 - Tara: oh shit
03/01/2022, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: HHhaa no it’s okay
03/01/2022, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: I can’t bother wasting energy on this tbh
03/01/2022, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: I know I told him he was too much at least like 5 separate time over the course of 4 weeks like what more does he want
03/01/2022, 21:37 - Sandeepti Singh: But I guess he needs something to blame so I’ll let him be
03/01/2022, 21:37 - Tara: i cannot succinctly express myself
03/01/2022, 21:37 - Tara: to reply to this
03/01/2022, 21:38 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/01/2022, 21:38 - Tara: yeahhhh
03/01/2022, 21:38 - Tara: who knew gifs would be so good
03/01/2022, 21:38 - Tara: millennials probably
03/01/2022, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I don’t get it though
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Tara: i dont think he has anyone to blame but himself
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Tara: once again he is twisting the story so he comes out as the victim
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but I guess that’s hard. Like I don’t think I did anything wrong either
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah that was a given
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s so annoying but I prepared myself for that hahah
03/01/2022, 21:39 - Tara: i will not whoop him
03/01/2022, 21:40 - Tara: you breaking up with him was probably enough of a downer for him
03/01/2022, 21:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Maybe I should have stayed longer and explained to him what he did wrong but it felt like overkill lol
03/01/2022, 21:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha fair enough
03/01/2022, 21:40 - Tara: i have more important things to do like laughing at how heroku reminds me of ayuko
03/01/2022, 21:40 - Tara: actually the entire day i thought it was heruko
03/01/2022, 21:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Did u know after the McDonald’s thing where I had ti try my hardest to not go off on him he had the audacity to ask for a kiss
03/01/2022, 21:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Like while we were waiting for a cab
03/01/2022, 21:41 - Tara: oh noooo
03/01/2022, 21:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Like sir I’m obviously still annoyed
03/01/2022, 21:41 - Tara: after all that?
03/01/2022, 21:42 - Tara: sorry for not picking up lol
03/01/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually yeah he ask for a kiss like 3/4 times that night and everytime I was like no there’s so many people each time
03/01/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I legit texted him the morning of the party to be subtle and chill
03/01/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: It was when u went to get the bag
03/01/2022, 21:43 - Sandeepti Singh: and anyways not ur fault in anyway lol
03/01/2022, 21:43 - Tara: yes i know

03/01/2022, 21:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I feel like I made the right decision no matter how vicitimised he feels as a result of his own actions and hoenaly selfishness
03/01/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay I’ll stop bad mouthing sorry

03/01/2022, 21:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I was worried that I do the romanticisation thing
03/01/2022, 21:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is a bit unhealthy
03/01/2022, 21:47 - Sandeepti Singh: But like when I no longer felt comfortable I ended it. Like I like that I won’t settle for something that I’m not 100% for
03/01/2022, 21:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay now I’m gonna go read for a bit

04/01/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: And since it’s a business course it’s very competitive marking
04/01/2022, 14:29 - Tara: Ew good luck

04/01/2022, 21:40 - Tara: oh damn girl that's productive

i aint matlabing myself
04/01/2022, 21:49 - Tara: by
04/01/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: I will ahhaha
04/01/2022, 23:01 - Tara: Will you ever read a little life
04/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: If not I'm gonna go on a mini rant
04/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: I hope ydm
04/01/2022, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm I might?
04/01/2022, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: But probably not lol
04/01/2022, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Rant  Head
04/01/2022, 23:09 - Tara: One character has like the most awful background ever and it's really bizarre
04/01/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Abused as a child in a monastery
Kidnapped by a brother and forced into prostitution
Finally escaped to social services where he was abused
Escaped and was picked up by someone who then abused him and eventually ran him over leaving him with a shit back and legs (chronic pain)
Finally he went to college made friends etc
Oh yeah also he cuts himself and refuses to see a therapist
Gets into an abusive relationship with someone who beat and raped him and left him for dead
Finally finally he's happy ish
Then his bff / lover died in a car accident
Then he took his life
04/01/2022, 23:12 - Tara: The author took the word trauma and managed to pack every unimaginable story into one poor character
04/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: She did not hold back
04/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Which is annoying and makes it seem like she wrote all this for the sake of it 
Like pardon me but it's just so unnecessary
04/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: I'd currently give it a 2.5/5 rating
04/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: "Critically acclaimed" lies
04/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: By the end of the story I think 1/4 original members survived
04/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Maybe 0.5 idk because the last dude was a drug addict
04/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: I'm not very generous when it comes to rating stuff tbh
04/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: I- my tenses are all over the place sorry
04/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I actually get what u mean
04/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: When shows add sad scenes just for the sake of it
04/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Thank you
I was worried I was minimising his experiences
04/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: No no you’re not mininimising his Experience you’re commenting on the author
04/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: I remember reading a review saying that she balanced the positive and negative experiences which is Not True
04/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: There's like two happy moments maximum
04/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Anyway rant over I don't recommend the book
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay lol
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I won’t read it
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: You know what is good though
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I am currently just not into anything
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is weird
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Which could make you cry if you want
04/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Shoot
04/01/2022, 23:20 - Tara: I think I told you before
Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine
04/01/2022, 23:20 - Tara: I liked it
04/01/2022, 23:20 - Tara: It's partly sad but it becomes hopeful towards the end
04/01/2022, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh okay I might check it out
04/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: Good

04/01/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: ?*

04/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: It's on par with motivational quotes
04/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Saying
04/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
04/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: What is the cult thing though?
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: I'll tell my followers
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: I gotta give something back to them
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: After the exorbitant fees
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: They deserve a lil something
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I think I’m one of ur followers though
04/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Yes
04/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: Ugh I'm going to be annoying now too
04/01/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha lol
05/01/2022, 09:18 - Tara: I emailed the MATLAB people and apparently we have a license already?
05/01/2022, 09:18 - Tara: If you want to you can email as well
05/01/2022, 09:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh what
05/01/2022, 09:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay
05/01/2022, 09:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol why did u email them
05/01/2022, 09:23 - Tara: Because I couldn't get a free trial
05/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh okay
05/01/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll email them later on? I already have the 30 days free thing
05/01/2022, 09:25 - Sandeepti Singh: By that time the class will actually start
05/01/2022, 09:25 - Tara: 👍👍
05/01/2022, 18:19 - Tara: Omg bro I just realised I'm finally an adult
05/01/2022, 18:20 - Tara: Instead of the ol plastic tiffin they gave me a glass one
05/01/2022, 18:20 - Tara: <Media omitted>
05/01/2022, 18:21 - Tara: Also I've decided to stop reading a little life because it's exhausting
05/01/2022, 18:22 - Tara: Also the chicken teriyaki sandwich is not as good as I remembered it
05/01/2022, 18:23 - Tara: 4am sandwiches really hit differently
05/01/2022, 18:31 - Tara: You can put that down as a book that almost broke me without making me cry
05/01/2022, 18:31 - Tara: Jude's way of thinking is terrible
05/01/2022, 18:56 - Tara: The more I think about it the more I dislike the book
There's no character development
It's comical a bit
Stereotypes galore
Their emotional capacity is nonexistent 
Were they actually Jude's friends they would have gotten him proper help instead of letting him get worse
05/01/2022, 18:56 - Tara: Sorry for the rant
05/01/2022, 18:56 - Tara: I'm just not a fan
05/01/2022, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah that’s how u know ur an adult??? Is that why I have never gotten it lol!
05/01/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: No. I only write down the names of the books that make u cry

05/01/2022, 19:21 - Tara: Has Efje
05/01/2022, 19:22 - Tara: There's one book that's made me cry
05/01/2022, 19:22 - Tara: But not for bad reasons
05/01/2022, 19:23 - Tara: I read a book about women in STEM and I was overwhelmed with pride for the Hwomen

05/01/2022, 19:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually though seyoon said doing matlab it probably a waste of time
05/01/2022, 19:25 - Tara: Today was terribly unproductive
05/01/2022, 19:25 - Sandeepti Singh: And I got the stuff from her
05/01/2022, 19:25 - Tara: Yay
05/01/2022, 19:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah same. I had fun

06/01/2022, 19:10 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz you know for normal fees i don't pay anything even though on SIS it shows i need to? like it just goes away in a bit
06/01/2022, 19:10 - Sandeepti Singh: is it the same for hall?
06/01/2022, 19:10 - Tara: Fak I keep forgetting to pay
06/01/2022, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: if it's not and i make the payment, how do they know if the payment is for school fees or hall
06/01/2022, 19:11 - Tara: I guess so

06/01/2022, 19:11 - Tara: Oh usually they show up at different times
06/01/2022, 19:11 - Tara: Or you'll just have to pay the whole thing

06/01/2022, 19:12 - Tara: I think it should be paid automatically
06/01/2022, 19:13 - Tara: Since your normal fees are paid automatically
06/01/2022, 19:13 - Tara: Should be the same for accommodation
06/01/2022, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: yea but on the other hand if that's not the case then my hall goes away right
06/01/2022, 19:13 - Tara: Do you know anyone else with a full scholarship

06/01/2022, 23:45 - Tara: Actually no it's just Efje idk why it's terrible
06/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Like it's that type of curve
06/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Whazizname
06/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: That distribution
06/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Which goes up then down
06/01/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Sim

06/01/2022, 23:47 - Tara: Lemme draw it
06/01/2022, 23:48 - Tara: <Media omitted>
06/01/2022, 23:48 - Tara: I think it's cos at the end of spring term she was planning to leave so I consciously drifted away so when she actually left I would be fine
06/01/2022, 23:49 - Tara: Is that a terrible thing to do
06/01/2022, 23:49 - Tara: It kinda became a habit
06/01/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: No it’s fine lol
06/01/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: U have very dif personalities so ig it could be draining
06/01/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: But now omg I’m just paranoid u talk like thins to other people about me 🥲🥲🥲🥲. Cuz efje and I are already so similar lol
06/01/2022, 23:50 - Tara: No I don't tell the others much
06/01/2022, 23:51 - Tara: This semester we're not as close as last spring
06/01/2022, 23:51 - Tara: Three cheese used to be a chat for Emotional Support
Now I just internalise everything
06/01/2022, 23:52 - Tara: The biggest difference is that you're more organised
06/01/2022, 23:52 - Tara: Which is less draining
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: Also I really don't talk about you to others
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay I’ll try to be less draining for real
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: Wat
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: You're not draining
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Is it that I talk too much
06/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: Hollup hollup
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: But it’s mostly cuz of like filling silence a
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Tara: The only other reason why I find Efje more draining than you is that she doesn't take care of herself
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Tara: Which is sad to see
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Tara: You're not draining at all
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Tara: I like talking to you
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh yea I agree
06/01/2022, 23:54 - Tara: If I found you draining I would have stopped the conversation long ago
06/01/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: If I am being draining tell me. I genuinely won’t take offence.
06/01/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Liek for future stuff
06/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: Sis you're not draining
06/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: I like that you talk a lot
06/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: It gives me food for thought
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay nice to know but if In case lol
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Like u can share more stuff if u wanna too
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: Oui
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: Thanks
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I think internalising some stuff is good which I mostly do but some more trivial? Stuff is good to share
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: Well now I gotta ask since you're mildly freaking out
Am I draining
06/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: I tell you my trivial stuff
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm no. Sometimes u go overboard with texting on gc but that’s like 1 out of a million times lol
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: And idm when u text a lot tbh
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Tara: I don't want to discuss anything with anyone unless it's with Ayuko
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: HHaha so no you are not draining
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Tara: Thank you
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha fair I’m not telling any one my trauma
06/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg I was so surprised
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Like one of the hall meet-ups
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: And sid and efje were like we share our trauma
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: And I was like huhhhhhhhhh
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Whyyyyyyyy
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Tara: Well I can tell you why it worked for me
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: And it’s not a comment on them
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s more like a reflection on myself
06/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Like how unwilling I am to tell stuff to anyone lol
06/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: Dude don't worry
06/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: With my high school friends we don't talk about this stuff much anyway
06/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: With Sid and Efje it kinda just happened one night
06/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: Which led to a whole other thing
07/01/2022, 00:00 - Tara: Telling people made me feel better because no one knew before uni
07/01/2022, 00:01 - Tara: Dw about it unless it's affecting you
07/01/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Nope I am great at forgetting 💁‍♀️
07/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea I didn’t like my high school friends but like I was the new kid so I didn’t have much option
07/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Lamp

07/01/2022, 13:56 - Sandeepti Singh: He didn’t outright say that but he said it by mistake
07/01/2022, 13:56 - Tara: Oh??

07/01/2022, 13:59 - Sandeepti Singh: But here’s what he said
07/01/2022, 13:59 - Sandeepti Singh: And on top of that the fact that she kept flirting with Siyoon in front of me during that party, and then just decided to FUCKING APOLOGISE afterwards.
07/01/2022, 13:59 - Tara: Apologise to Sid?
07/01/2022, 13:59 - Tara: Oh man that's an angry txt

07/01/2022, 14:00 - Tara: I'm annoyed at him
07/01/2022, 14:00 - Tara: He said they had resolved it
07/01/2022, 14:00 - Tara: By leaving it be
07/01/2022, 14:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Like that’s the less angry part
07/01/2022, 14:00 - Tara: I'm disappointed in him
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Tara: So goddy disappointed
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk if he actually feels this way or he’s just saying it to justify

07/01/2022, 14:01 - Tara: I mean he's saying all this
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Tara: It can't be that he made it up
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: So this whole thing is an excuse
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but it’s scary
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Tara: To get into your good graces(?)
07/01/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: He was hella jealous of efje
07/01/2022, 14:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol bad judgement
07/01/2022, 14:02 - Tara: Who does he think you are
It's not like you'll automatically jump to his side
07/01/2022, 14:02 - Sandeepti Singh: I am madder than I  thought I would be
07/01/2022, 14:02 - Tara: Ditching Efje

07/01/2022, 14:02 - Tara: This is serious
07/01/2022, 14:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Like he said when I was physically close to efje he would wanna be closer???
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Like  i don’t wanna be the one to tell efje this
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz she’ll feel so bad

07/01/2022, 14:03 - Tara: But bro this is so bad
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Sandeepti Singh: She absolutely shouldn’t
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Tara: How can he just bitch about her like that
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Don’t do anything about it yet
07/01/2022, 14:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Gimme a few minute I need to find my way
07/01/2022, 14:04 - Tara: Okay
07/01/2022, 14:04 - Tara: I never thought he was this toxic
07/01/2022, 14:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea same
07/01/2022, 14:04 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s very disturbing
07/01/2022, 14:04 - Tara: After everything I thought he was genuinely a good friend
07/01/2022, 14:05 - Tara: Kinda scared if he harbours some resentment towards me now lmao
07/01/2022, 14:05 - Tara: Or just any of his supposedly close friends
07/01/2022, 14:06 - Tara: Three cheese is turning into de brie
07/01/2022, 14:06 - Tara: I love cheese puns
07/01/2022, 14:08 - Tara: Bro he once called us / our friendship toxic because apparently we're too supportive or something
07/01/2022, 14:08 - Tara: As in three cheese
07/01/2022, 14:09 - Tara: Aiyah we need to come up with a plan
07/01/2022, 14:09 - Tara: But what's the intended outcome
07/01/2022, 14:09 - Tara: Kicking him out?
07/01/2022, 14:13 - Tara: Theoretically the best thing would be to talk to him
But it would just lead to an argument
07/01/2022, 16:21 - Sandeepti Singh: No that’s not nice I guess
07/01/2022, 16:21 - Sandeepti Singh: But yeah I don’t know how to resolve it
07/01/2022, 16:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz it seems like there’s a lot of animosity
07/01/2022, 16:21 - Sandeepti Singh: And it won’t just go away???
07/01/2022, 16:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh yea we need to make a game plan
07/01/2022, 16:22 - Sandeepti Singh: He also said he was hurt when I said he cares too much about small things sometimes??? There by proving my point lol
07/01/2022, 16:22 - Sandeepti Singh: I kid
07/01/2022, 16:36 - Tara: Couples counselling but for friends
07/01/2022, 16:36 - Sandeepti Singh: This is literally the plot of falcon and the winter soildier
07/01/2022, 16:37 - Tara: Optimal solution = us sitting down and ~completely destroying Sid~ talking about it
07/01/2022, 16:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I second it
07/01/2022, 16:38 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I’ll talk to him first
07/01/2022, 16:38 - Sandeepti Singh: And tell him to sort it out
07/01/2022, 16:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz bro why do I need to put it with this insane amount of jealousies
07/01/2022, 16:39 - Tara: Ya it's not great

07/01/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I refuse to watch tv on phone
07/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: True but they're actually leading the troops it's ridiculous
07/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: Not that the Vietnam war want
07/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: Wasn't
07/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: They're both stupid

07/01/2022, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Funny!
07/01/2022, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: ?*
07/01/2022, 20:08 - Tara: Ironic
07/01/2022, 20:08 - Tara: They escaped the war and later started another one
07/01/2022, 20:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhhh

07/01/2022, 21:30 - Tara: Bro I'm confused they've infiltrated the castle and it looks like it's going well 
But there's still an hour left
07/01/2022, 21:32 - Tara: Oh nvm
07/01/2022, 21:37 - Tara: Oh god that was dumb
07/01/2022, 22:36 - Sandeepti Singh: HahA
07/01/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Ahahahah sorry I gotta say the random capitalisation is really bizarre
07/01/2022, 23:10 - Tara: In his message
07/01/2022, 23:11 - Tara: ....so he practically hates Efje now
07/01/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Oh jeez this is worse than I thought
07/01/2022, 23:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah it was weird
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Reminiscent of my email to shrlo
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: No no this won't do
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Ok sure he's entitled to his opinion whatever
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea we need to do something
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: But he's been letting it stew for more than a month
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Which is really really bad
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup. So much so that it caused a break up lol
07/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Ffs he's stupid
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Bro I even told him to prioritise you and his feelings for you
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: What the hell
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Dummy
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: 😳
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: The blush is for u
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Ya know the meanest thing I told him apparently
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Smh he doesn’t deserve it rn
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Why does he care
07/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: I give context
07/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: He was talking about Vignesh and Vinayak liking you and how he feels bad for them or something and I recalled you saying that he was sabotaging himself
07/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: So I basically said their opinions / feelings don't matter lmao
07/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Ah yes how they would react when they found out you two were dating
07/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Why does he seem to care more about others than you (sorry for being blunt)
07/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: You my friend

07/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Duh

08/01/2022, 12:33 - Tara: I got sister's opinion
08/01/2022, 12:33 - Tara: She doesn't think we're going too far
08/01/2022, 12:33 - Tara: And agrees with what we talked about last night
08/01/2022, 12:34 - Tara: But she also thinks you should warn Efje 
Just like Sid has something to talk to you about
08/01/2022, 12:34 - Tara: That I'm not 100% sure about
08/01/2022, 12:34 - Tara: If you want to could you ask Prisha if we should tell Efje
08/01/2022, 13:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh okAy maybe a small warning might be helpful but i think it sid should be the one to tell her the actual thing
08/01/2022, 13:45 - Sandeepti Singh: We could just tell her to hear him out and mAybe think carefully instead of just apologising or stuff
08/01/2022, 13:45 - Sandeepti Singh: And yea I’ll ask prisha or sim but let’s see
08/01/2022, 13:46 - Sandeepti Singh: I have a feeling they won’t really care lol
08/01/2022, 13:46 - Tara: Ok fair enough
08/01/2022, 13:46 - Tara: So we warn after you tell him?

09/01/2022, 14:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Then I ended up spending the rest of the day trying to cheer him up/distract him from the pain
09/01/2022, 14:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I have to do the same today + study a bit cuz I couldn’t last night and that’s the real reason I’m not gonna come

09/01/2022, 18:01 - Tara: My curiosity will kill me one day
09/01/2022, 18:01 - Sandeepti Singh: So I also hope it’s not infected or that they’re no stray thorns left in his foot

10/01/2022, 19:00 - Tara: I'm watching the mysterious Benedict society
10/01/2022, 19:00 - Tara: Because it's on Disney+
10/01/2022, 19:00 - Tara: And no one told me about it
10/01/2022, 19:00 - Tara: So I'm sad
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: I have never heard of this in my life
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Tara: Aw man you should read the books
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Tara: So fun
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Tara: It has a similar vibe to a series of unfortunate events
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Tara: Aka it involves children
10/01/2022, 19:01 - Tara: Anyway it's nice
10/01/2022, 19:02 - Tara: A childhood book series
10/01/2022, 19:02 - Tara: Omg I need to lend you some books
10/01/2022, 19:02 - Tara: I did not finish the Greek one
10/01/2022, 19:02 - Tara: Along with that I'll give you the mysterious Benedict society 1 and 2
10/01/2022, 19:02 - Tara: For I still have to read 3
10/01/2022, 19:40 - Sandeepti Singh: The thing is I know my pacing isn't an absolute, it's something I adjust constantly with everyone. But the main reason I feel so hurt/want to try is because I felt like u never got to know the full me and I didn't get to know the full u, and I felt like our relationship ended with a maybe instead of a *definitely*.
10/01/2022, 19:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Its true u don't need to know the whole me to know If we r compatible, but I want u to so that its no longer a maybe
10/01/2022, 19:40 - Sandeepti Singh: but if u feel like its a definitely, then I accept it, and we can just go back to being friends
10/01/2022, 19:58 - Tara: Hmm our talk got me thinking
10/01/2022, 19:58 - Tara: What if Efje also low-key hates Sid
10/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: Bruh how annoying
10/01/2022, 20:01 - Tara: But then she wouldn't have invited him for cake
10/01/2022, 20:01 - Tara: Nah she probably doesn't
10/01/2022, 20:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Did u ask her to invite him
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: Good point I did
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: She would've said no though
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: If she says no to u then it’s basically admitting
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: Wonderful
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: She's gonna be devastated then
10/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Like on the weekend u wanted to go to that Peruvian thing u  said u invited sid right
10/01/2022, 20:03 - Tara: Yeah cos he was there
10/01/2022, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanted to ask u not to invite him but I was like if I say that then that basically means telling u that I don’t wanna hang out with him
10/01/2022, 20:03 - Tara: I wanted to go with just you guys
10/01/2022, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Same
10/01/2022, 20:03 - Tara: Lol I take that back I just wanted to go with Prisha you and Simran

10/01/2022, 20:04 - Tara: Which is saying something since they're 💯
10/01/2022, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s a lie. I am way more fun though

10/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: She's at your home?
10/01/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I came back from my jog and was ambushed by Khushi’s entire family
10/01/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: No one told me
10/01/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I was so surprised
10/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: Hhhhh

10/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m drafting my text to sid now lol
10/01/2022, 20:24 - Tara: Aha it takes five minutes to find stickers
10/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno what to say
10/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I know right there should be a search button like with emojis
10/01/2022, 20:25 - Tara: Yeah they need a tag/label function my god
10/01/2022, 20:25 - Tara: I can't embarrass myself like this
10/01/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I find it hilarious that his WhatsApp dp is legit me and efje talking animatedly in the background lol
10/01/2022, 20:26 - Tara: Yeah hahaha I can see her laughing
10/01/2022, 20:27 - Tara: Well remember what we said
10/01/2022, 20:27 - Tara: You got this
10/01/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Yes ma’am
10/01/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Bruh he still replying back with counter arguments
10/01/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: This time I’m legit gonna say that I don’t appreciate that he’s not taking no for an answer (like I’ll phrase it better)
10/01/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: but the simple truth is u were the easiest person I found to talk to and that's y I liked u, and all I wanted was to just be close   to u, and make u happy cause that's how u made me feel
10/01/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: if that's not what u want, or if that's not how u think I act then I understand
10/01/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Like is he still waiting for a reply then???? Or is this it???
10/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: Dhakxjahc
10/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: He's saying the same thing again
10/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: And again
10/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: That's so goddamn annoying
10/01/2022, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah it really is annoying
10/01/2022, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I don’t think I should just leave him on read
10/01/2022, 21:17 - Tara: Luckily for you he turned off read receipts
10/01/2022, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I should probably say something to reiterate that we’re just friends now
10/01/2022, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Also I low-key wanna say that u should have that much needed chat with efje ughh I wanna be there
10/01/2022, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I feel like there’s stuff there that should be said that y’all might not say
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Tara: To Sid right
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea hahah sorry
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Not gonna tell him I wanna be there that part was for u lol
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I really am a bad tester
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Texted
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Texter
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Tara: Oh so I talk to Efje too?
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Tara: Yeah that's a good idea because if she does say something now
10/01/2022, 21:19 - Tara: But not then
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: Then I'll be like girl
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: Don't hide it
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah lemme talk to her too cuz I guess technically he sent them to me
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: And we give her a warning
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: Yeah
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: What are you gonna say
10/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: Eh I trust you
10/01/2022, 21:21 - Sandeepti Singh: I guess main point is ask her what she thinks about sid first in like an honest way and then tell her the super brief version of what sid said and ask her how she feels about it then share what we feel about it
10/01/2022, 21:21 - Sandeepti Singh: So as to not lead her way or thinking
10/01/2022, 21:21 - Sandeepti Singh: But also sharing what we feel as food for thought lol
10/01/2022, 21:22 - Tara: Yes yes
10/01/2022, 21:22 - Tara: Agreed
10/01/2022, 21:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Do we call her then
10/01/2022, 21:26 - Tara: Oh lord

10/01/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: She’s free
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: But I may have set the wrong tone
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Tara: Aaaaa
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Tara: Did you just say we need to talk
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Tara: Girl
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Tara: Too happy
10/01/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I over corrected
10/01/2022, 21:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Call
10/01/2022, 21:36 - Tara: How
10/01/2022, 21:36 - Tara: I call you?
10/01/2022, 21:37 - Sandeepti Singh: And then we try adding her
10/01/2022, 22:38 - Tara: Venti hot chocolate no whipped cream
10/01/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: https://youtu.be/p5l174CliKE
10/01/2022, 22:49 - Sandeepti Singh: https://youtu.be/xgQ8BJdkN5U
10/01/2022, 22:55 - Tara: im getting ready for bed i'll be back
10/01/2022, 23:01 - Tara: Hello
10/01/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Ok so good / bad news
Bad news - I always have epiphanies like an hour after the conversation
10/01/2022, 23:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Hhah
10/01/2022, 23:02 - Sandeepti Singh: What’s the good news?
10/01/2022, 23:02 - Tara: Good news - I now know what I'm gonna say on Sunday
10/01/2022, 23:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Shoot
10/01/2022, 23:04 - Tara: So between spring and their argument it was all good
We were talking and stuff
Then it suddenly stopped
And like for me it was because during the argument Sid made it seem like we failed at maintaining our mental health
And I know I told him to buzz off about my progress
But there's still that part of me which is scared to tell him anything because I feel that internally he'll be dismissive and be like ugh again?
10/01/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Aw man I guess I also haven't resolved anything with him 😑
10/01/2022, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha ma’am maybe do it then too
10/01/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Yes
10/01/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Smh
10/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: In my defence I've only just realised this
10/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: No that's a lie
10/01/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Aren't you glad to be friends with a messy-ass group
10/01/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Bro how am I gonna be an impartial person
10/01/2022, 23:11 - Tara: This will be difficult
10/01/2022, 23:11 - Tara: But you know what I'm partially responsible for this mess I will help us get out of it
10/01/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh but yeah that’s such a shitty thing to feel like. Like as a friend u should just be there for someone if they need help not add to the worries
10/01/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah y’all are so messy. I think you’re all just really different people
10/01/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: And that’s fine
10/01/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: I've asked sid, tara, siyoon, and efje. All said yes, efje has yet to respond
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: About the party?
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s it. That’s eveyone that’s coming
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: I said I'll have to talk to my parents first
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Which is true
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Wonderful
10/01/2022, 23:13 - Tara: Oh man
10/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Hahahaha
10/01/2022, 23:14 - Sandeepti Singh: What lol
10/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Hopefully the thing between you and Sid is completely over
But if not (knock on wood) then half the group has some unresolved issues
10/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Imagine that
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Toxicity
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Not like anyone's gonna act out
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: But it's just there
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah we’re like a good Indian fam that will fight when we get home
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: But sid and I are done
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Good
10/01/2022, 23:15 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: Forgive me but I partially and temporarily hate them solely because of all this drama
10/01/2022, 23:16 - Tara: I like tea
Not drama
10/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: They made a gc for the charisma’s think
10/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: U hate me too 👉👈
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: No man
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Your drama doesn't affect me
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Theirs does
Haha I'll be moderating but in a weird way
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: They didn’t add cuz u said u need to talk to parents
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: But
10/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: BUT
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Khushi is coming
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Wat
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: And so is Simar
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Wat
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: 🥲🥲🥲🥲
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Ok I'll try my best to be there
10/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: No doubt they would latch onto you
10/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Bro I said this before and I'll say it again 
I'm the child of two divorcing parents
10/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: I will find a way to keep them together for my own needs
10/01/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
10/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: If they're not gonna be together who else is gonna listen to my breakdowns
10/01/2022, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Aww bro first of all they won’t divorce
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Tara: Hahaha
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Second even if they did they’ll still be friends with u
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: And imagine this
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: You’ll be like a child with two christmases
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Talk about ur breakdowns twice
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Tara: Pfffff
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Tara: Ma'am
10/01/2022, 23:22 - Tara: Actually thank you
10/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: Interesting analogy
10/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: I mean I started it but thank you for running along with it
10/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: Well I always have Ayuko
10/01/2022, 23:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah 3 christamses
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: She's our grandmother(?)
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: I mean my grandmother
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Not me though. Like feel free to talk to me but expect a pat pat at most
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Or some vague ancestor
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Tara: Yeah I was gonna say that but didn't want to offend you
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Nah nah
10/01/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t tell any of my friends and they don’t tell me
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: But that’s why the relationship works
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: For me
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Oui and I will keep it that way
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Everyone’s different
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: So do u
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: In fact if you haven't then just forget everything I told you about whazizname
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: Thank you
10/01/2022, 23:25 - Tara: I will pretend I never told you
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah no no don’t go to such extreme lengths
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: I kid but do feel free to tell me stuff
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s just I probs won’t tell u stuff but that’s not to offend u it’s just I don’t tell anyone stuff
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Tara: Idk why but I always regret telling people stuff
So I will 100% be doing this
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: No haha
10/01/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Don’t regret
10/01/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Regrets are for dead people
10/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: Hhhh where did you get that from
10/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: How are you so articulate
10/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
10/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Years of writing on Wattpad ✨✨✨
10/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: Good practice yes
10/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Oh this is good news
According to Efje I'm a closed book how nice I thought I was too open with people
10/01/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Sorry just last thought
10/01/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah why u apologising
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: I dunno I need to stop
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: Hehe Yuen Yin knows nothing about me
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: And she never will
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s okay lol
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Tell people as little or as much as u wanna tell them
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Tara: Yes
10/01/2022, 23:30 - Sandeepti Singh: I think people probably think I’m an open book
10/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: Probably
10/01/2022, 23:31 - Tara: But as they get closer they realise they don't know as much as they thought
10/01/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m having a very normal friendly conversation with sid and it’s scary
10/01/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha so funny but can’t confirm nor deny lol
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: It is funny
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: And ironic
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Why do Indians/ brown peopel use …. In text
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s so ominous and i hate it
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Ban them
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: Ikr but then they never actually have bad intentions
10/01/2022, 23:32 - Tara: They're just brown
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Tara: Is Sid sending ellipses
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: This out of context sounds so wrong
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Tara: Block him
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: ☝️
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: He told me not to call him bro
10/01/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz he texted me and my mind went call him bro lol
10/01/2022, 23:34 - Tara: Omg bro

10/01/2022, 23:34 - Tara: Inappropriate authority crush
10/01/2022, 23:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh right
10/01/2022, 23:34 - Tara: Forgetting their ex's name
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Tara: This is actually hilarious
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah lmao
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: A bit sad
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Tara: True
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: But let’s focus on the hilarious aspect
10/01/2022, 23:35 - Tara: Sometimes I forget the deeper reasons and go haha he dumb
10/01/2022, 23:36 - Tara: I suppose he's been friendzoned by people he's asked out too
10/01/2022, 23:36 - Tara: That's good though
10/01/2022, 23:36 - Tara: Hasn't affected their relationship
10/01/2022, 23:36 - Tara: So nice that people are chill and understanding about these things
10/01/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah cuz stuff happens haha
10/01/2022, 23:37 - Tara: Eggjactly

10/01/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: And no no I don’t wanna burden u and it’s not anything serious
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Tara: Right off the bat I feel like you could just be overly nice and act like he's your bro
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Tara: But that probably won't happen
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: But maybe just sit next to me cuz I dunno how he’s gonna act u know
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Tara: Ya np
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Tara: Sit next to my besties
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Tara: I will take a chill pill
10/01/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: No trust me when I say when I talk to him as someone on the outside who doesn’t know anything will probs never realise that anything is going on
10/01/2022, 23:39 - Tara: Yea yeah
10/01/2022, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: But just in case cuz what if he still like tries to do stuff that comes off as too much

10/01/2022, 23:39 - Tara: But _just in case_
10/01/2022, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Just a bit uncertain about how he’ll act
10/01/2022, 23:40 - Tara: I will be a lil wary
10/01/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup thank u but like nothing too extra

10/01/2022, 23:42 - Tara: I'm just an idiot

10/01/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Not the ripped backside
10/01/2022, 23:44 - Tara: Idk why his stiches are ripping
10/01/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I saw a comedy show that had a toy and there were some jokes made and I can’t not think of them
10/01/2022, 23:45 - Tara: I'm so annoyed
It would be a good sticker if the stiches were not ripping
10/01/2022, 23:45 - Tara: Fine I find another
10/01/2022, 23:45 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: I'm assuming Hansika sent this to you

10/01/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh sorry

10/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: But it was too small to read
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Hahaha
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Tara: Acceptable
10/01/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/01/2022, 23:47 - Tara: Is this another thing you wanted to read or should I give a pep talk

13/01/2022, 13:34 - Sandeepti Singh: he'll probably just text again though

13/01/2022, 13:34 - Sandeepti Singh: but i don't wanna be rude about it
13/01/2022, 13:34 - Tara: then tell him that
13/01/2022, 13:34 - Tara: or maybe say you'll talk about it when the term starts?

14/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: haha they let it go on for so long their conversation won't have an effect on anything
14/01/2022, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: I think u care a lil bit but you know it will affect u badly if it ends up being bad so you’re just not acknowledging it

14/01/2022, 20:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Don’t be sad cuz they’re both too chicken to actually end the friendship
14/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: He knows if he has beef with efje then he probs won’t be able to hang out with the girls
14/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: So he’ll be motivated to fix it
14/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: And she told me she just wants to get it over with and resolve it

16/01/2022, 14:25 - Sandeepti Singh: and been really rude
16/01/2022, 14:25 - Tara: Shenme the fuck
16/01/2022, 14:26 - Tara: How bad is it my god
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Sandeepti Singh: no he took it as a compliment lol
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i am just so mad rn
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Tara: You're gonna have to provide a lil more context
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Tara: What did he take as a compliment
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Tara: You asking him about their talk
16/01/2022, 14:27 - Tara: Or the alcohol thing
16/01/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: yea you always feel bad on behalf of others whether they do or not
16/01/2022, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz he was like i insulted vinayak really badly
16/01/2022, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: and that he felt bad
16/01/2022, 14:29 - Tara: How did you insult him
16/01/2022, 14:30 - Tara: I'm going for lunch bye
16/01/2022, 14:30 - Tara: I'm very confused about all this
16/01/2022, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah okay bye
16/01/2022, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: no he was saying how he stopped talking to me at the party cuz i was drunk
16/01/2022, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i wasn't even drunk i was tipsy
16/01/2022, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: but it's a bit rude. idk why i feel like it's him saying like i'm a shitty person or something just cuz i had a bit to drink
16/01/2022, 14:48 - Tara: He's gotta get off his high horse about alcohol
16/01/2022, 14:48 - Tara: Also what happened with Vinayak
16/01/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i called him vignesh and then corrected myself
16/01/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: but like i do that all the time
16/01/2022, 14:49 - Tara: O
16/01/2022, 14:49 - Tara: So Sid felt bad on Vinayak's behalf even though Vinayak probably doesn't care
And it's an insult?
16/01/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz there names are similar and i don't think it's that offensive given that i was a bit tipsy
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah exactly
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: like he's always on some fucking high horse
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Tara: Ngl I also sometimes get the girls mixed up but no one cares??
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Tara: Because it's a tiny mistake
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: like apaprently yesterday he had to avoid me and stop to me a bit cuz he thought i was too drunk
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: i legit only had beer
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: and i was a little tipsy
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: like nye bro
16/01/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: he always makes it seem like such a fucking big deal
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: when u guys drink u loose a bit of ur filter, which is normal
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: and the thing is that can sometime lead to saying small things that can hurt, but sometimes I don't feel comfortable with it
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: I choose not to talk much when u guys drink cause I want u guys to have ur fun while being able to have the comfortability of knowing I won't get hurt
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Tara: Drunk people are so funny they're extra as hell hahaha
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: like i dunno he just always wants me to feel bad for the smallest of stuff
16/01/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't get it
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Tara: I don't get it what did anyone say while drunk which hurt him 
I suppose besides Efje saying that thing
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Sandeepti Singh: bro yea but also you've seen me drunk. I'm like in control the most i do is get a little flirty but that's not harming ayways
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but bro she's apologised for that so many times already
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't get it
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Tara: I feel like he's still stuck on that
16/01/2022, 14:52 - Sandeepti Singh: yea exactly
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: Because afaik no one has said anything to him which would have hurt him
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: While drink
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: Drunk
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: I don't get it 
He needs to give examples
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Sandeepti Singh: yea i legit have told him that i haven't said anything drunk to him that i wouldn
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Sandeepti Singh: 's sober
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: Yeah
16/01/2022, 14:53 - Tara: You drunk and you sober are like pretty similar
16/01/2022, 14:54 - Sandeepti Singh: he mentioned merilyn
16/01/2022, 14:54 - Tara: What did she say 
She just did a stupid thing but was fine in the end
16/01/2022, 14:54 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno bro
16/01/2022, 14:54 - Sandeepti Singh: he's doing some werid guilt tripping thing that he doesn't realsie
16/01/2022, 14:54 - Sandeepti Singh: like he wants me to feel sorry for him or something
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Sandeepti Singh: it's cool though sorry for ranting at u and adding to ur plate
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Tara: I guess he was just scared for her
But Efje had it mostly under control
We got her to an Uber
Joyce said she was fine
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Sandeepti Singh: it's just i wanted to know if I'm actually somehow a different person when i drink without realising
16/01/2022, 14:55 - Tara: Oh my plate is empty
16/01/2022, 14:56 - Tara: IMO I don't think you are a different person
16/01/2022, 14:56 - Tara: He has some ideas that drunk people only do stupid things
16/01/2022, 14:56 - Tara: Which isn't true
16/01/2022, 14:58 - Tara: Well it's not his place to judge
16/01/2022, 14:58 - Tara: We didn't involve him in any way
16/01/2022, 14:59 - Tara: Btw don't apologise about ranting thanks
16/01/2022, 14:59 - Sandeepti Singh: yup omg u put my thougths into words
16/01/2022, 14:59 - Tara: The only thing that stresses me out is myself haha not you guys
16/01/2022, 14:59 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks a lot lol 👉👈
16/01/2022, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh but yea it was just a bit annoying cuz he's always on this shigh horse thing and wants the other person to feel bad for him
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: but i refuse to give in and feel bad when the thing he's saying is not something i'd agree with 100%
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Tara: 👏👏
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Tara: Self respect
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: this is why i think i made the right choice not going further with him we're just too different lol
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: thank u hahah
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: okay now to finish my sa presentation
16/01/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm so close to being done too haha
16/01/2022, 15:02 - Tara: All of the girls he's almost asked out aren't the type to bend to his bs which is good
16/01/2022, 15:02 - Tara: You deleted this message
16/01/2022, 15:03 - Tara: You deleted this message
16/01/2022, 15:03 - Tara: I see presentation after I make mother coffee
16/01/2022, 15:04 - Tara: Well it better be a wake-up call for him
Also I hope he doesn't tell us about his new crush because tbh I will not be as supportive as I was before
16/01/2022, 15:04 - Tara: But second chances
16/01/2022, 15:04 - Tara: We'll see
16/01/2022, 15:04 - Tara: He needs to get off his high horse with his friends first
16/01/2022, 15:05 - Sandeepti Singh: no don't delete
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme read pls
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Tara: No it was a bit much
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: no ma'am i don't judge
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: plssss
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Tara: K fine
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Tara: Was saying that whenever I think of whoever Sid's had a crush on I'm glad they said no
16/01/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah we all have the will of a dry autumn leaf on a windy day
16/01/2022, 15:07 - Tara: Especially Tanushree idk why
16/01/2022, 15:07 - Tara: Probably because our groups were too intertwined
16/01/2022, 15:07 - Tara: Then it would have been messy
16/01/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: oohh
16/01/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: you know the weird thing so you know how we used to call right
16/01/2022, 15:08 - Sandeepti Singh: at the start of the call he was legit talking about how whenever he sees siyoon he still goes back to thinking how he likes her
16/01/2022, 15:08 - Sandeepti Singh: but then by the end of the call i was like oh we can date and be causal and see where it goes you kniw
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Shenme
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Sus
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Idk how else to describe it
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Sandeepti Singh: and then the next day all of a sudden he's going on about how he liked me for a week already
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Sandeepti Singh: and started doing this extra stuff you know
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Something doesn't add up
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: I guess you could have multiple crushes
16/01/2022, 15:09 - Tara: At the same time
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Sandeepti Singh: that's why i said it seemed too much cuz a lot of it didn't seem to come genuinely but rather than that something he made up just cuz he wanted us to work out for the sake of it
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but you know it went from talking about seeyonn to no i was actually into u for a whole week already
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Tara: Idk why it seems like one of you was a safety net
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Tara: Ya know what I mean
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Tara: Idk how to describe it
16/01/2022, 15:10 - Sandeepti Singh: like -20 to 100
16/01/2022, 15:11 - Tara: Ah yes he was doing a Tara
Playing both sides of the game
16/01/2022, 15:12 - Tara: We do not stan

16/01/2022, 15:12 - Tara: Yeah no that me was cancelled
16/01/2022, 15:13 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha i'm sorry the old tara can't come to phone right now. why? because she's dead
16/01/2022, 15:13 - Tara: Eggjactly
16/01/2022, 15:13 - Tara: 2022 is a time for growth
16/01/2022, 15:14 - Sandeepti Singh: yessss
16/01/2022, 15:14 - Tara: Ha once he blamed me for the tiramisu thing

16/01/2022, 15:16 - Tara: Ah yes
16/01/2022, 15:16 - Tara: My bad
16/01/2022, 15:16 - Sandeepti Singh: the only thing u did was give me the courage to end it tbh
16/01/2022, 15:16 - Tara: Well in the end it was all you
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Slide 6 
Did you just add the universities you applied to
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Tara: Oh
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Tara: It looks a bit cluttered
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it's a personal thing
16/01/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh also u can click on notes cuz it might give context on what i wanted to talk about
16/01/2022, 15:19 - Tara: Love how you circled 45
Like 💁‍♀️
16/01/2022, 15:19 - Tara: We love to see it
16/01/2022, 15:19 - Sandeepti Singh: no cuz i need to talk about my scholarship haha
16/01/2022, 15:19 - Sandeepti Singh: but i'm still wondering how to do it without seeming like I'm bragging
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Tara: Brag away
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: help me out with that slide lol
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: how do i add that i got 45
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: but like in a lowkey way
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Tara: I would just remove the circle
16/01/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: wow i was gonna add an arrow and be like this is the one i got hahah
16/01/2022, 15:21 - Tara: And you don't wanna brag??
16/01/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
16/01/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: like she talked in detail about her scholarships
16/01/2022, 15:23 - Tara: In slide 1 maybe if you move up the SENG pic higher it would be a bit better
16/01/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: so i thought i meant i should talk about mine two
16/01/2022, 15:23 - Tara: Nice
16/01/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: hahahis that photot of me okay
16/01/2022, 15:23 - Tara: Ok yeah but maybe an arrow is too much
The circle is fine
16/01/2022, 15:24 - Tara: Yeah man it's perfect
16/01/2022, 15:24 - Tara: Yikes they really made the scholarship stricter
16/01/2022, 15:25 - Tara: Got in at the right time phew
16/01/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah omg
16/01/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: should i remove that? and just say it instead
16/01/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: like just have something like they have scholarship for 40 and above
16/01/2022, 15:26 - Tara: Circle? No

16/01/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah i have no idea what to write for that
16/01/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: "the scholarship i ended up getting"
16/01/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: sounds too informal
16/01/2022, 15:33 - Tara: In the textbox?
16/01/2022, 15:33 - Tara: I don't think you need it
16/01/2022, 15:33 - Tara: The arrow is pretty self explanatory once you get to talking about it
16/01/2022, 15:33 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh okay
16/01/2022, 15:33 - Tara: Or you can say "my score" if you really want to
16/01/2022, 15:34 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't want to but i also wanna subtly point out which scholarship i got lol
16/01/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: oh last slide yayy
16/01/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i need to put stuff for hall life

16/01/2022, 16:02 - Tara: Do you need inspiration
16/01/2022, 16:02 - Sandeepti Singh: i need to put pics of fun stuff i've done
16/01/2022, 16:03 - Sandeepti Singh: but like i don't think i've done anything fun in hall tbh
16/01/2022, 16:03 - Tara: Ok but that's gonna be difficult with covid restrictions and whatnot
16/01/2022, 16:03 - Tara: Usually we hang out in a big group no
16/01/2022, 16:03 - Tara: They'll be like hhhh

16/01/2022, 19:18 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao i sounds like an indian mother
16/01/2022, 19:19 - Tara: Ma'am I hope you know what you're doing because this did not help with Efje and Sid
16/01/2022, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: the reason to avoid is cuz i guess the thing i dislike is just his core personality
16/01/2022, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: like he can't change that lol
16/01/2022, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: it does make me mad that i made him mad

16/01/2022, 19:34 - Tara: How did he react
16/01/2022, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: oh he made fun of me for being stupid and told my parents lol
16/01/2022, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: but then i later told him don
16/01/2022, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: don't tell mama and papa they assume every guy i mention is someone I'm dating
16/01/2022, 19:36 - Sandeepti Singh: he went "oh i hope you're not dating sid cuz we have the same name and that would be so weird"
16/01/2022, 19:36 - Sandeepti Singh: I have no idea how to respond to that
16/01/2022, 19:56 - Tara: Be dramatic and say oh I would never
16/01/2022, 19:56 - Tara: And then do a dramatic cape flip
16/01/2022, 20:03 - Tara: Bruh how are you the person I call the most
16/01/2022, 20:03 - Tara: It's not even my mom or sister anymore

16/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: Because then I'm gonna hate him
16/01/2022, 20:08 - Tara: Actually it's a bit late 
That controlling selfish overdramatic putting his nose into other people's business jealous manipulating dick
16/01/2022, 20:08 - Tara: Sorry
16/01/2022, 20:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah that makes me happy 👉👈
16/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: No no omg don’t hate him
16/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I am telling the stories so there’s probably some bias there
16/01/2022, 20:09 - Tara: Yeah it'll ruin everything
16/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I promise I won’t tell u any stories anymore
16/01/2022, 20:10 - Tara: Pls if he told us then at first we would be like omg no and then a few hours later we'll be like bitch what just happened
16/01/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh? I don’t get
16/01/2022, 20:11 - Tara: He tells us a story in his way which will make us feel sympathetic towards him
Then realise what he said was completely out of line
16/01/2022, 20:11 - Tara: Once he told us he was disappointed that we weren't friends with Vignesh because he's a really nice guy
16/01/2022, 20:11 - Tara: But like sir we don't have to be friends with him if we don't want to
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea the guilt trip
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: Excuse me I need to talk to him
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: I am familiar
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm?
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: No it's not wise
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: I wanna tell him to stop being a manipulative dick
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: No it would make stuff worse I think
16/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: But then he'll be like huh where did you get that from
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Tara: Which will expose everyone
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Tara: And yep set things back
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea I guess we just let it be
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I’m sure there’s bad stuff about me that u put up with
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I’m loud and I barely have a filter lol
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Tara: Honestly not really
16/01/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: So just put up with him like u do with me ?
16/01/2022, 20:14 - Tara: Like I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart
16/01/2022, 20:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I don’t think it will all end up okay if we do end up talking about it
16/01/2022, 20:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz u know how he percieves stuff is his core belief and u can’t change that
16/01/2022, 20:14 - Tara: I don't think you've done anything to hurt me or anyone
16/01/2022, 20:14 - Tara: Sid however
16/01/2022, 20:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Ugh I hate that I am saying this but yea we need to put up with it
16/01/2022, 20:15 - Tara: I mean maybe when we were first friends you used to double book which was annoying
But not anymore

17/01/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: https://images.app.goo.gl/apeqoP5fJ6nkYdjV7
17/01/2022, 18:22 - Tara: 🤡👸😇👹🚨
17/01/2022, 18:38 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/01/2022, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: ma'am re-reading messages and in that last go i went off on his ass
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Tara: oh girl
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Tara: what did you say
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: 🙄
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: no no in a good way
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: it ended well i think
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: but ma'am
17/01/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme give excerpts of what i said
17/01/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: u knew what u were signing up for don't act like it was a surprise. i was honest about how i felt the whole way through
17/01/2022, 20:25 - Tara: oh for a second i thought that was sid
17/01/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: nothing gives you the right to act if u have a moral high ground on all things when u literally only do nice stuff when it benefits you. you did nice stuff for siyoon cuz u wanted to like her back. u literally told me that you're nice to people cuz u think it'll lead to some sorta romantic thing with them on one of the phone calls
17/01/2022, 20:25 - Tara: smh you both use contractions
17/01/2022, 20:26 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah this was re him telling me that he was hurt when i told him to slow down
17/01/2022, 20:26 - Sandeepti Singh: wait context for that:
17/01/2022, 20:26 - Tara: 👏
17/01/2022, 20:26 - Sandeepti Singh: and then you went from being so so into siyoon one day to being so into me all of a sudden do you realise how dishonest and not genuine that feels
17/01/2022, 20:26 - Sandeepti Singh: that bit ws the context for the first bit lol
17/01/2022, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha tell me if u want me to stop sorry
17/01/2022, 20:27 - Tara: no go on
17/01/2022, 20:27 - Tara: it's nothing new lol
17/01/2022, 20:27 - Sandeepti Singh: and wtf is up with you feeling hurt cuz i led u on???? i had to break up with u like 7 different times in 7 different ways cuz you kept saying "but i understand if you want to end it" and then not actually letting me end it.
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: you hurt me too it's just that i don't go around making u feel guilty for every little thing because i did care about u.
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: last one, probably most brutal, regret it a bit:
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Tara: are you sure haha
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: . but a real relationship takes time and effort and you just wanted to skip to like 6 months later but it doesn't work like that. i feel like you want a relationship so badly you don't actually know how to be in one because u just have this idealised idea of what its supposed to be.
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Tara: yeahhhh
17/01/2022, 20:28 - Tara: love it
17/01/2022, 20:29 - Tara: i wouldnt feel bad
he needs a wakeup call
17/01/2022, 20:29 - Sandeepti Singh: there was a bunch of other sappy stuff cuz i was like bitch u making it seem like i didn't care for u i did but I'm not gonna expose myself hahah
17/01/2022, 20:29 - Tara: fair enough
17/01/2022, 20:30 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao i feel so much better now and there's no way it's getting dragged on so dw
17/01/2022, 20:30 - Sandeepti Singh: it is all resolved
17/01/2022, 20:30 - Tara: i hope so
17/01/2022, 20:30 - Tara: for me and efje at least he is not bestie no 1
17/01/2022, 20:30 - Sandeepti Singh: same cuz he said he won't drag it on any longer
17/01/2022, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: omg i also said this: i won't be guilt-tripped into staying together with you or feeling sad for u when i was also hurt by the decision
17/01/2022, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: bruh
17/01/2022, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i've savage
17/01/2022, 20:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i love me

18/01/2022, 18:14 - Tara: i dunno i never applied
18/01/2022, 18:14 - Tara: maybe the harvard exchange?
18/01/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Aiya I’m too ceebs to do research so imma just let it be
18/01/2022, 18:21 - Tara: the bad thing is that the ""good"" universities
18/01/2022, 18:22 - Tara: don't offer a cs exchange
18/01/2022, 18:22 - Tara: like toronto
18/01/2022, 18:22 - Tara: and a lot of UC's
18/01/2022, 18:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahh yeah I heard u talk about it before
18/01/2022, 18:29 - Tara: hey when do you think you'll take lang4031
18/01/2022, 18:29 - Tara: or the other lang course
18/01/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Dunno yet
18/01/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: U?
18/01/2022, 18:30 - Tara: i dunno either
18/01/2022, 18:30 - Tara: just deciding whether it would be wise to take it in year 3
18/01/2022, 18:30 - Tara: it should be fine 
i took 2030 in year 1
18/01/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea I don’t think it should be a problem
18/01/2022, 19:56 - Tara: idk what the hell i was doing earlier because i just redid my pathway and i have so much space now
18/01/2022, 19:56 - Tara: but there's one course i have to do which prevents me from going on exchange which is fine again
18/01/2022, 19:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh so you’re not gonna do exchange at all
18/01/2022, 19:57 - Tara: nope
18/01/2022, 19:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Also u know u can do some courses during exchange for better grading or something
18/01/2022, 19:57 - Tara: yeah you told me
18/01/2022, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: So imma do that
18/01/2022, 19:58 - Tara: hmmm
18/01/2022, 19:58 - Tara: do they give you a list of equivalent courses
18/01/2022, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: No as in a course from ust during exchange
18/01/2022, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I think we can go out but still do the course from ust
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: ohh
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: so it's what online?
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: as in the ust course
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m not sure I overheard it while tipsy at a party so I might not be the best source lol
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Siyoon and Simar were talking about it
18/01/2022, 19:59 - Tara: hahaha
18/01/2022, 20:00 - Sandeepti Singh: And I need to ask siyoon about it later on or do research myself
18/01/2022, 20:00 - Tara: oops
18/01/2022, 20:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Bro question if my whole focus next sem is to maintain grades and I feel like I can afford to just do 14 credits do I bother taking 3 elec courses to go to 18 or just stick with 14???
18/01/2022, 20:01 - Tara: how many did you take this sem
18/01/2022, 20:01 - Sandeepti Singh: 14
18/01/2022, 20:01 - Tara: oh
18/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: uhh
18/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: i've been doing 17-18 so idk
18/01/2022, 20:02 - Tara: i would have just done 18
18/01/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I meet all graduation requirements without doing 18 though
18/01/2022, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Maybe I should ask other people who’re taking 17/18 credits and maintaining a good gpa
18/01/2022, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I am genuinely confused
18/01/2022, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Like Vinayak is taking 17 next sem but he’s taking math 2011 which I already finished
18/01/2022, 20:04 - Tara: he hasn't taken it yet? damn
18/01/2022, 20:04 - Tara: the heck was he doing last year
18/01/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Idk lol
18/01/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: To be fair I did a lot of random courses introductory courses cuz I was so confused about which major to do
18/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: ngl i dont think the number of credits exactly correlates to how good / bad your cga is
just depends on the courses you choose
18/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: that makes no sense
18/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: nvm
18/01/2022, 20:06 - Tara: point is
you wont not do well if you take 17/18 credits
18/01/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I guess it does though in the sense that more workload u have the less u spend on each course so I guess more likely to get a worse grade
18/01/2022, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea true but I guess the likelihood increases. But then again I only took 14 this sem lol
18/01/2022, 20:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I did get above mean for all hahah the grading was fucked
18/01/2022, 20:07 - Tara: exactly
18/01/2022, 20:08 - Tara: you know you can do well
why not try extending yourself
18/01/2022, 20:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I really really don’t wanna loose a 100K hkd lol
18/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Aghh lemme double check my pathway too then
18/01/2022, 20:09 - Tara: up to you
ive realised that my advice lately has led to unintended consequences ✨
18/01/2022, 20:09 - Tara: so i will refrain from stuff
18/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA
18/01/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I won’t blame u anyways cuz it’s me who ends up making the decision
18/01/2022, 20:10 - Tara: oh it's not even you
18/01/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: But I will ask other people
18/01/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh can I email and ask my advisor
18/01/2022, 20:11 - Tara: last year my mom asked if she should reach out to my high school physics teacher or the woman who was helping me a bit during IB
told her to go witht he lady
she was Terrible
so yeah no not a great choice
18/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: maybe terrible is too harsh
18/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Reach out for what?
18/01/2022, 20:12 - Tara: oh to hire
18/01/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh
18/01/2022, 20:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Hello
18/01/2022, 20:42 - Tara: hello
18/01/2022, 20:42 - Tara: do you know if you can take the co-op thing in the very last semester
18/01/2022, 20:42 - Tara: like in year 4
18/01/2022, 20:43 - Sandeepti Singh: No clue
18/01/2022, 20:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Just assume I don’t know stuff about my pathway
18/01/2022, 20:44 - Tara: ok you said hello what's up
18/01/2022, 20:44 - Sandeepti Singh: I had no idea I liked sid this much
18/01/2022, 20:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz like it officially ended yesterday
18/01/2022, 20:44 - Sandeepti Singh: And I’m so annoyingly sad about it
18/01/2022, 20:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I can’t believe I’M crying over a guy
18/01/2022, 20:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Like ME???
18/01/2022, 20:45 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>

18/01/2022, 20:49 - Tara: hahaha are you crying while trying to console yuen yin
18/01/2022, 20:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea hahah
18/01/2022, 20:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually no I stopped crying when she texted and now I’m worried over my pathway instead
18/01/2022, 20:50 - Tara: mood
18/01/2022, 20:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Rather be worried over pathway than sid lol
18/01/2022, 20:50 - Tara: im so confused
18/01/2022, 20:50 - Sandeepti Singh: I think she’s more worried about job market thing for her major
18/01/2022, 20:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Not graduation
18/01/2022, 20:51 - Tara: oh in that way
18/01/2022, 20:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea
18/01/2022, 20:51 - Sandeepti Singh: How am I an empath bruh
18/01/2022, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: I miss him!?!????!!! That is a surprise to me too
18/01/2022, 20:54 - Sandeepti Singh: But also is it that I miss him or that I heard that 1 song that reminds me of him
18/01/2022, 20:54 - Tara: probably the latter
18/01/2022, 20:54 - Tara: y'all dated for a week
18/01/2022, 20:54 - Tara: less than a week
18/01/2022, 20:55 - Tara: how far did you go jeez
18/01/2022, 20:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea but if I am being honest I had that weird small like for him for so long
18/01/2022, 20:55 - Tara: in terms of emotional committment
18/01/2022, 20:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Again the only reason I asked out max was a counter measure
18/01/2022, 20:56 - Tara: i'm sorry i dont have much advice
only time will heal such wounds
18/01/2022, 20:56 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m sorry I legit don’t know where this is coming from
18/01/2022, 20:56 - Tara: it's ok
18/01/2022, 20:56 - Tara: mourning what was lost
at least you're not thinking about getting back with him rigt
18/01/2022, 20:57 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
18/01/2022, 20:57 - Tara: for your sake
please don't
18/01/2022, 20:57 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m not gonna dw it’s just that I keep thinking about it
18/01/2022, 20:59 - Sandeepti Singh: Sorry lol
18/01/2022, 20:59 - Tara: no it's ok
18/01/2022, 20:59 - Tara: i was getting confused about my pathway again
18/01/2022, 21:00 - Tara: i have a weird gap between year 3 and 4
18/01/2022, 21:00 - Tara: anyway
18/01/2022, 21:00 - Tara: you cry however much you want
18/01/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Wdym gap
18/01/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: I didn’t cry that much. Like for the duration of the song twice
18/01/2022, 21:01 - Tara: <Media omitted>
18/01/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: So 6 min max
18/01/2022, 21:02 - Tara: i really could apply for an exchange...
18/01/2022, 21:02 - Tara: i need to talk to parents
18/01/2022, 21:02 - Tara: it's a weird gap because the courses in year 4 term 1 are only offered in fall
18/01/2022, 21:02 - Tara: but it doesn't make sense to take those courses before the year 3 courses
18/01/2022, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
18/01/2022, 21:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Then do a minor then but yea do exchange
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: oh i fixed it
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Sandeepti Singh: That is phrased so weirdly
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: no exchange
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: whoops
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh great lol
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: 122 credits
18/01/2022, 21:16 - Tara: yeet
18/01/2022, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Nicee
18/01/2022, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m doing my pathway now too
18/01/2022, 21:20 - Sandeepti Singh: And I’m surprisingly on track
18/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: good luck
18/01/2022, 21:20 - Tara: ayy that's good
18/01/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: How do u only get 122 credits???
18/01/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: You should def have more
18/01/2022, 22:07 - Tara: oh 152
18/01/2022, 22:07 - Tara: including credit transfer
18/01/2022, 22:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea that makes more sense
18/01/2022, 22:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno why everyone’s taking so many credits each sem
18/01/2022, 22:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I planned it out
18/01/2022, 22:17 - Sandeepti Singh: And I get to do exchange plus be 15 credits max each sem
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Am I doing something wrong hahah
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: i have no idea
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: who else is taking 17
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I matched it up with the required list and it works
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Siyoon was gonna take like 21
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Tara: sid - robomasters & a minor presumably
me - minor
efje - iim
18/01/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Vinayak was taking 18 I think
18/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: vinayak and siyoon i have no idea
18/01/2022, 22:19 - Tara: maybe they just wanna graduate early
18/01/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Nah not as far as I know
18/01/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
18/01/2022, 22:20 - Tara: oh man from next sem we're only gonna be in elec1200 together
18/01/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Eh one’s enough cuz I’m on campus so we meet up anyways
18/01/2022, 22:21 - Tara: yeah
18/01/2022, 22:21 - Tara: well it's inevitable i will fuck up 2400 regardless
18/01/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: So I guess yea it’s either I get minor or exchange
18/01/2022, 22:22 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought u were gonna take 2400 next sem
18/01/2022, 22:22 - Tara: not anymore
18/01/2022, 22:22 - Tara: i'll show you
18/01/2022, 22:22 - Tara: ohhhh
18/01/2022, 22:22 - Tara: also i have one semester reserved for co-op
18/01/2022, 22:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
18/01/2022, 22:23 - Tara: oh man am i doing somethingwrong
18/01/2022, 22:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh I think I’ll do fyp instead so that’s 6 credits spread out over 2 sems
18/01/2022, 22:24 - Tara: oh god no i have all circuits in one semester
18/01/2022, 22:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh also don’t u need to have 9 credits to be considered a ust full time student
18/01/2022, 22:24 - Tara: fuck
18/01/2022, 22:25 - Tara: yeah so i'm going to take a ""study leave"" probably
18/01/2022, 22:25 - Tara: while working
18/01/2022, 22:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I haven’t decided electives yet lol
18/01/2022, 22:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Too many choices
18/01/2022, 22:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Lemme do that now
18/01/2022, 23:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao I ended up taking no electives from elec whatsoever
18/01/2022, 23:11 - Sandeepti Singh: And I dunno if that’s allowed lol
18/01/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: But at least I’m doneeeee
18/01/2022, 23:14 - Tara: Yayy
18/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: What did you choose
18/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Ha I tried choosing all electives closest to comp
18/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: It was basically a choice of circuits versus everything else
18/01/2022, 23:15 - Tara: And I chose Not Circuits
18/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Smort choice
18/01/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Basically same
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: ^^
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I am gonna do 3511 over exchange cuz that’s what the reviews suggest
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Tara: Very nice
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno how that works yet but Simar said that she’s gonna take it over exchange
18/01/2022, 23:17 - Sandeepti Singh: And yea I choose to do exchange over minor i dunno why lol
18/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: But I am gonna do masters anyways
18/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: So i think it’s fine if I don’t have minor
18/01/2022, 23:18 - Tara: It don't matter
Do whatever you want
18/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah daure
18/01/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Can u read it haha I realise it’s too small
18/01/2022, 23:19 - Tara: Yeah I can dw
18/01/2022, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: I wanted to do some of the BDT courses u put but they had terrible reviews for some reason
18/01/2022, 23:21 - Tara: 🤷‍♀️ some reviews are pretty old
18/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm trueee
18/01/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Plus some had like 2 reviews
18/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: Yeah
18/01/2022, 23:27 - Tara: Well I'm not gonna worry just gonna try my best
18/01/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea yea dw about it
18/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I just also don’t find the topic interesting so maybe that’s why it would’ve been harder for me anyways
18/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: By then I'd have hopefully become more proficient in data science
18/01/2022, 23:28 - Tara: I'm trying to find a fun project to do
18/01/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I took courses that seemed to pop up a lot in the internship offers

23/01/2022, 23:48 - Tara: oh true
23/01/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: But I genuinely didn’t like her then lol
23/01/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Just the last like 2/3 days I’ve been hanging out with her non-stop
23/01/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: And idk it’s completely diff than sid u know
23/01/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Like we just have fun and stuff but that’s not a reason I should date someone lol
23/01/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: So we’re just gonna sit back and watch where it goes lol (99.9999% it should go nowhere)
23/01/2022, 23:49 - Tara: that's what i was thinking

23/01/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno

23/01/2022, 23:52 - Tara: i cannot answer that for you obvs go overthink
23/01/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Like u know we keep subtly touching most of the time cuz we were sitting together
23/01/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: And like I was soooo aware of it
23/01/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno though
23/01/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m not gonna overthink and just see what happens
23/01/2022, 23:52 - Tara: oui good idea
23/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: i will not suggest anything because i know if you two get together then there's gonna be Grief
23/01/2022, 23:53 - Tara: but there shouldn't be
23/01/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea 🥲. Like I feel like we’ll get along.
23/01/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh u know

23/01/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: So I was asking what was that about lol
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: And remember I told u she said she had a crush on me like 3 separate times which I can’t remember
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: mhm
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: And I remember being so mad at her around that time cuz she would be so rude/distant to me and I thought she hated me
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: oh my lord
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Tara: is that her coping mechanism 🤦‍♀️
23/01/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: According to her it was overcorrection cuz that’s when she liked me but wanted to not be obvious about it and tried to hide it
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: you guys are so funny
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: not sure why
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH and especially cuz apparently it was around the time when she was gonna leave too
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: but this is funny
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: So she was also distancing cuz she was gonna leave
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Like u sorta did with her
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: hmm yeah i think i got some vibes from her then too
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha 🥲
23/01/2022, 23:56 - Tara: re you
23/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh????
23/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: I was not informed by anyone
23/01/2022, 23:57 - Tara: she left, came back and everything was normal again
23/01/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I remember ranting to prisha and sim anout how she hated me
23/01/2022, 23:57 - Tara: never knew she liked you then
23/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno I can’t remember the exact three-ish time?
23/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: My memory is shit lol
23/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: But she def said the distancing herself and over correction but
23/01/2022, 23:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Bit
23/01/2022, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: And idk I remember we were both smiling guiltily in a weird manner like lost opportunity you know
23/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: well now we know what to look for
23/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: aww
23/01/2022, 23:59 - Tara: as in aww that sucks not aww that's cute
24/01/2022, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: And she went like yeah can’t happen now cuz u dated sid (not exactly what she said this sounds rude)
24/01/2022, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: And me suddenly remembering liek oh yea I did date sid
24/01/2022, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: And completely forgetting the repercussions lolll
24/01/2022, 00:00 - Tara: not him getting in the way of a potential love story i'm definitely happier about
24/01/2022, 00:01 - Tara: picture this

24/01/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz yea I don’t even know for sure if I like her ???
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Ma’am u encouraged me to ask sid
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Tara: ok pls tell me if you do so i can start orchestrating this
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: But I love that u’r always so supportive
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Tara: true
in hindsight though
bad idea
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Tara: half bad idea
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah my bad lol
24/01/2022, 00:02 - Tara: that's what friends do
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno I low-key liked him but like I didn’t like being with him
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Tara: even last year when she was Confused™️ about you and cynthia
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Sandeepti Singh: My god that’s so much like in one sentence
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Tara: i was team sandeepti because i didnt like cynthia tbh
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Tara: her vibes
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Tara: were off
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Tara: ~still dislike her~
24/01/2022, 00:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea but i had no idea Cynthia was that big a deal to her you know
24/01/2022, 00:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Like no way am I gonna be someone’s second choice lol
24/01/2022, 00:04 - Tara: fair enough
24/01/2022, 00:04 - Sandeepti Singh: When sid told me later on that efje described me as a blip I was so mad
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I didn’t like her then lol I was kinda the same as now like hmmmm if u think about it, it would work out really well but was still a bit mad
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: So hypocritical of me
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: 🤡
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I wish I just liked people normally instead of always being in this limbo of do I like them or not!
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Tara: yeah blips = fleeting
24/01/2022, 00:05 - Tara: how do i say this
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: a fleeting like for someone idk
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: no
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: yes
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: confusion
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: that was her
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: this
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Tara: im good at english
24/01/2022, 00:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooohhhh that makes sense
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: But she was like in love in love with Cynthia
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I am not a rebound u settle for 😌
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Wow I have so much self respect I’m amazing lol
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Tara: you're not a rebound
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Tara: 👏👏
24/01/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s like 90% thanks to u hahah
24/01/2022, 00:08 - Tara: it was 
cynthia - prolly in love with her but wouldn't work out 
sandeepti - a fun, more casual relationship which would definitely have been better for her
24/01/2022, 00:08 - Tara: no
self respect comes from within
24/01/2022, 00:08 - Tara: 95% you 5% me encouraging you
24/01/2022, 00:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhhh that makes sense but also no✨ cuz u can’t be in love with someone else and just choose me cuz it’ll be easier
24/01/2022, 00:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Mostly cuz I had no idea it was that big lol
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Tara: true
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Sandeepti Singh: She did mention Cynthia but always in a way more past tense way if that makes sense
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Tara: yeah
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Tara: i once told her to end it with like all the girls she was seeing at one point
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Tara: i hope she did
24/01/2022, 00:10 - Tara: not seeing seeing
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Tara: but loose ends sorta 🙈
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Tara: including cynthia
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha how many??? This sounds like a whole been
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Tara: because that girl was 100% leading her on
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Harem
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Tara: like three?
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Whaaat including me!
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Sandeepti Singh: ?*
24/01/2022, 00:11 - Tara: no
24/01/2022, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Haha when was this
24/01/2022, 00:12 - Tara: so she was into cynthia and siyoon
and was basically hooking up with aisha
24/01/2022, 00:12 - Tara: mid sem
24/01/2022, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg wait remember those insta texts I showed u!!? Like at the start ish of feb when she texted me and was like I just woke up today and just have no feelings for Cynthia
24/01/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: And then asked me out a few days later lol
24/01/2022, 00:13 - Tara: cynthia - leading on, would not work out
siyoon - straight
aisha - no, would not be a good influence
24/01/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Cynthia is not even here anymore though
24/01/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Wow people can like people so much it’s so bizarre to me

24/01/2022, 00:17 - Tara: man does she really end things with people as soon as she has feelings for others
24/01/2022, 00:17 - Tara: and then goes back to said person
24/01/2022, 00:17 - Tara: after pursuing whatever with person 2

24/01/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Like told me she didn’t have feelings for Cynthia, went out with me, thought it won’t workout (my bad there I panicked and freaked a bit), and went back to being in love with Cynthia
24/01/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha yea but ig they weren’t actually dating
24/01/2022, 00:19 - Tara: oh what

24/01/2022, 00:22 - Tara: the only good thing about chokers is that they can hide hickeys
24/01/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA and turtlenecks

04/02/2022, 23:03 - Sandeepti Singh: I genuinely don’t know what type of show u like so I have no clue what to recommend
04/02/2022, 23:03 - Sandeepti Singh: But I think when I recommended archer, efje liked it
04/02/2022, 23:05 - Tara: I also don't know what things I like
04/02/2022, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg omg
04/02/2022, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Can I recommend Manga
04/02/2022, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: 👉👈
04/02/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Yes I'm always open to stuff
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Just recommend stuff that's not sci-fi and we'll be good
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Tara: Wait maybe sci-fi is ok
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Tara: I just hate dystopia
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh okay
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m sorry but most of mine are romance
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Tara: I also hate action films
04/02/2022, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s all I read
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Those are my two limitations
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Sandeepti Singh: For some reason
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: If it's a dumb series like the Feyre one
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: No
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Ok in conclusion
Young adult books = bad
04/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: Just that entire group
04/02/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Which is why sister's recommendations fall flat
04/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Okay one is this: https://www.mangago.me/read-manga/koimonogatari/
04/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: I sent it to efje and she liked it
04/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh wait no young adult
04/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: What does that encompass
04/02/2022, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz some of mine are like love stories ish from high school
04/02/2022, 23:09 - Tara: The combination of romance + fantasy
04/02/2022, 23:09 - Tara: Also romance
04/02/2022, 23:09 - Tara: But romance + fantasy is a godawful combination IMO and I hate it
04/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lmao this is a bad match then cuz all of mine are romance
04/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: But they do tend to be gay and slightly more profoundv
04/02/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Evelyn Hugo was good tho
04/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Like this one is cute: https://www.mangago.me/read-manga/bokura_no_shokutaku/

04/02/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah plot wise banafish isn’t my type
04/02/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: I tend to hate overdone sad backstories
04/02/2022, 23:12 - Tara: Evelyn Hugo, song of Achilles, Circe were 10/10
04/02/2022, 23:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz like it stops being realistic if that makes sense

16/02/2022, 16:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Same but at least they’ll talk about it in class on Monday
16/02/2022, 16:45 - Tara: huh they made a spelling error in this
saticfices
16/02/2022, 16:45 - Tara: probably meant sacrifices
16/02/2022, 19:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Hey for 2600 how are the corollary’s tested? Like does elec have proofs?
16/02/2022, 19:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Or is it just questions
16/02/2022, 19:35 - Tara: in the homework there was one proof question
16/02/2022, 19:35 - Tara: but it wasn't like PMI
16/02/2022, 19:36 - Tara: oh btw don't skip the tutorials because they go over similar questions to the homework
16/02/2022, 19:36 - Tara: and the python code
16/02/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh yup I’m going to tutorials
16/02/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Btw how many questions did u do from each section cuz there’s so many. I started doing all but I might Switch to doing all odd questions
16/02/2022, 21:11 - Tara: I did all of them
16/02/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Some questions I skipped because they covered functions not covered in class
16/02/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh okay
16/02/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: I think the questions I was doing in the beginning were just the boring easy ones
16/02/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: So I can skip but I think for later ones I’ll do all
16/02/2022, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: I say I skipped but I ended up skipping like 4 cuz I kept feeling like it’s all important hahah
16/02/2022, 21:57 - Tara: Yeah mood
17/02/2022, 12:15 - Tara: hey how are you revising for elec1200

17/02/2022, 12:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah same
17/02/2022, 12:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I like it so much more when there’s questions to practice

17/02/2022, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i should have prefaced by saying this meeting on sat when we were thinking of doing the elec thing
17/02/2022, 21:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i may still be able to do it at 12 but I'm just not too sure
17/02/2022, 21:22 - Tara: Oh no problem I'm free any time
17/02/2022, 21:22 - Tara: Is that the teaching course
17/02/2022, 21:24 - Sandeepti Singh: the underwater robot course which may have elements of teaching but I'm not sure yet
17/02/2022, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i have no clue why i'm doing it except that it sounded like fun.
17/02/2022, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it's not even graded, it;s just pass/fail
17/02/2022, 21:26 - Sandeepti Singh: oh I have a question from elec 2600
17/02/2022, 21:44 - Tara: Shoot
17/02/2022, 21:45 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
17/02/2022, 21:46 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't think they ever mentioned it in the lecture or stuff?
17/02/2022, 21:49 - Tara: Wait do you understand the P[A] bit
17/02/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: not for the biased coin, nk
17/02/2022, 21:50 - Tara: Ok gimme a couple of minutes gotta reply to something
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah no rush
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm just doing this for myself anyways so doesn't even have to be today hha
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Tara: Sacrilege
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Tara: Ok so
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Tara: P[A]
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Tara: The probability of 1 is p
The probability of 0 is (1-p)
17/02/2022, 21:51 - Tara: Since it's biased
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i get it
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: actually i get the whole question now
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Tara: Lemme write this down nvm
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Tara: Oh yay
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: you just assume the probability as variables
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh yea then it's easy
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Tara: Yep
17/02/2022, 21:52 - Sandeepti Singh: for 100 it's just p * 1-p * 1-p
17/02/2022, 21:53 - Sandeepti Singh: thanksss
17/02/2022, 21:53 - Tara: Oui
17/02/2022, 21:53 - Tara: Nice

17/02/2022, 23:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Like why did he all of a sudden leave and stuff
17/02/2022, 23:04 - Tara: Well I certainly didn't tell him anything if that was a concern
His insecurities flaired up
17/02/2022, 23:05 - Tara: Flared
17/02/2022, 23:05 - Tara: But he saw your story
put two and two together
17/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: It was weird because I'm not a comforting person
I wanted to talk to y'all about it because you're more articulate
17/02/2022, 23:07 - Tara: But obviously I could not
17/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: No it’s not a concern I trust u
17/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: And even if u do tell him I would never blame u lol
17/02/2022, 23:08 - Tara: Tenks
17/02/2022, 23:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Eh I figured he would
17/02/2022, 23:08 - Tara: I have learnt

17/02/2022, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: The waffles looked so good so I posted
17/02/2022, 23:09 - Tara: Fair enough
17/02/2022, 23:10 - Tara: So messy right
17/02/2022, 23:10 - Tara: Delicious yet messy
17/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno I feel like not tagging her or only one of us putting it would be hiding or soemthing which would be more devious?
17/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh fuck it was so messy
17/02/2022, 23:10 - Sandeepti Singh: It gave me a stomachache

17/02/2022, 23:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Efje says I self-diagnose everything hahah
17/02/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Ok but whenever you have some dairy based dessert you seem to not feel well after
17/02/2022, 23:15 - Tara: And you're Indian
17/02/2022, 23:15 - Tara: But who even cares
17/02/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Eat as much dairy as you want
17/02/2022, 23:15 - Tara: Oh man how do you survive tiramisu

17/02/2022, 23:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Just tiramisu
17/02/2022, 23:16 - Tara: <Media omitted>

18/02/2022, 11:37 - Tara: Nah it can't be _that_ bad
18/02/2022, 11:37 - Tara: Everyone else is a beginner anyway
18/02/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah they did a poll of who’d done mat lab before
18/02/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: And only 7% were beginner, everyone else was none
18/02/2022, 11:38 - Tara: I may have put intermediate
18/02/2022, 11:38 - Tara: Because my god they made us use pointers
18/02/2022, 11:38 - Tara: That's not beginner stuff
18/02/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah hahah I still put beginner
18/02/2022, 17:06 - Sandeepti Singh: question
18/02/2022, 17:08 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 17:09 - Tara: 2^8 is 256 right
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yea i get part 1 is 256 then 1/256
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Tara: Probability of failure would be 255/256
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Tara: Uh
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Tara: Ok I'm gonna have to get back to you I have huka
18/02/2022, 17:10 - Tara: Huma
18/02/2022, 17:11 - Tara: Sorry
18/02/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah yeah whenver i have question feel free to respond whenever
18/02/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: no problems at all
18/02/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: don't apoogise bro u
18/02/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: 'r doung me a huge favour
18/02/2022, 17:16 - Tara: So the first time you fail that probability would be 255/256
 part b says you fail first then succeed
255/256 * 1/256
18/02/2022, 17:16 - Tara: Fail and succeed
18/02/2022, 17:18 - Sandeepti Singh: oh that's still very different to actual answer
18/02/2022, 17:18 - Tara: Oh what seriously
18/02/2022, 17:19 - Tara: What's the answer
18/02/2022, 17:19 - Tara: Hmm
18/02/2022, 17:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 17:19 - Sandeepti Singh: i get what they're doing
18/02/2022, 17:20 - Tara: Ohh
18/02/2022, 17:20 - Tara: So 255/256 is failure on the first go
254/255 is failure on the second
18/02/2022, 17:20 - Tara: Then they're taking the 1-p of that
18/02/2022, 17:20 - Sandeepti Singh: yeahhh i think prob questions are phrased so weridly sometimes
18/02/2022, 17:21 - Tara: Haha I like this workshop TA
18/02/2022, 17:21 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh thanks eve nthough i lowkey disagree with the actual answer hahah

20/02/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhh
20/02/2022, 23:49 - Tara: Oh no it disconnects when I leave to check WhatsApp I think
20/02/2022, 23:49 - Tara: For me
20/02/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: whhaaat no
20/02/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: okay do whatsapp call then lol
20/02/2022, 23:50 - Tara: but I am currently in a state where I feel as though I have to literally learn to cut all my feelings for the two of them. Cause no matter what their intention, they really just played with my heart and it rlly does fucking hurt
20/02/2022, 23:50 - Tara: The thing that bugs me with Sandeepti is that in the beginning she always was worried that I still had feelings for Siyoon, and asked if I was being flirty. So in response I quite literally ghosted Siyoon just to make her feel more comfortable, and Siyoon brought it up to me when she was leaving to Korea. And the thing is I rmbr all the flirty things Efje and Sandeepti did with each other, and the fact they did date briefly, so like how physically touchy they were at times just didn't make me comfortable but they both made me feel as though I *had* to be ok with and I just didn't like it. I just don't understand why Sandeepti can't see that, or why she wouldn't be willing to do anything in spite of it
20/02/2022, 23:50 - Tara: so I think I may still need longer to come back, but if/when I do. I think its only if/when I can completely cut all feelings off from the two of them. Cause loving them, and feeling that disparity of care, just hurts too fucking much
20/02/2022, 23:51 - Tara: I understand that they just shared one kiss, but u have to understand that's enough to give a feeling of uneasiness or jealousy
20/02/2022, 23:51 - Tara: I wasn't asking them to stop, I was trying to let her know why I felt hurt and insecure when she said she was more comfortable like physically with Efje than me
20/02/2022, 23:51 - Tara: the reason I felt hurt by Sandeepti was the fact that I had to work so hard to prove to her that I didn't like Siyoon, and I just wanted her to understand the reason I lashed out was because I honestly loved her so much and Efje that I hated that I felt jealous so fucking much, but it just reached a point that I couldn't keep it in
20/02/2022, 23:51 - Tara: 1 wasn't willing to put in as much I tried, while never believing the genuitiy of my actions
20/02/2022, 23:51 - Tara: and the other who hurt me several times, and I *forgave* only hurt me more in one if the most difficult things I have ever experienced
20/02/2022, 23:57 - Tara: I wasn't expecting nor asking her to go from 0 to 100, I told her I was literally happy with the pace and I made sure to be okay with it. But if u can't understand why someon would feel jealous when their gf is more physically comfortable with someone else they kissed once than u. Then there is nothing more that I can say
20/02/2022, 23:57 - Tara: I don't
It was months ago
20/02/2022, 23:57 - Tara: Goodnight
21/02/2022, 00:01 - Tara: I dont like that I feel like this, and I understand that u guys may never understand y I feel like this. That's y I'm considering to do the painful thing of cutting them from my life, cause I care too much
21/02/2022, 00:13 - Tara: the reason I felt hurt by Sandeepti was the fact that I had to work so hard to prove to her that I didn't like Siyoon, and I just wanted her to understand the reason I lashed out was because I honestly loved her so much and Efje that I hated that I felt jealous so fucking much, but it just reached a point that I couldn't keep it in
21/02/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I really hope he didn’t tell siyoon that I made him ghost her or something
21/02/2022, 00:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz bruh I never ever said that
21/02/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Bro this is legitimately none of my business why is he getting me in this
I'm gonna tell him that because I don't want to be involved
21/02/2022, 00:34 - Tara: This is between you three
21/02/2022, 00:35 - Tara: I mean not even between you three
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Tara: But his string of messages was stressful
Whenever I thought about reading his messages my head started hurting
So I'm gonna talk to him later
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah bro u honestly don’t have to waste ur time on this
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Tara: Next time he brings it up
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: U have no need to be his therapist he can unload stuff on
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Tell him that
21/02/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Like tell him if u don’t wanna be constant dragged into this drama
21/02/2022, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Which had absolutely no fucking need to be dragged out this long
21/02/2022, 00:59 - Tara: hahahaha efje is drunk

24/02/2022, 14:41 - Tara: Ugh annoying
24/02/2022, 14:41 - Tara: Do you still wanna figure it out beforehand
24/02/2022, 15:14 - Sandeepti Singh: is your tutorial a day before ur lab?
24/02/2022, 15:14 - Tara: no same time
24/02/2022, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: oh damn i guess i could attend ur tutorial and my Monday is free so I'm free to work on lab right after

24/02/2022, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: 2600 lectures are moslty pointeless anyways cuz it's the course where i read ln and do the questions to understand stuff
24/02/2022, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: so idm watching the lectures on wed or something
24/02/2022, 15:17 - Tara: did your timetable change i thought you had the lab that day too
24/02/2022, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah my lab changed to friday
24/02/2022, 15:17 - Tara: ohh
24/02/2022, 15:17 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz vignesh and i wanted to be in the same lab
24/02/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: is that okay with u? that i attend ur tutorial and then do the lab with you
24/02/2022, 15:18 - Tara: yah fine ok let's do it then
24/02/2022, 15:18 - Tara: the previous lab didnt take that long right
24/02/2022, 15:19 - Tara: after we got through task 2
24/02/2022, 15:19 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah and if they give us answers in tutorial it should take even less time
24/02/2022, 15:19 - Tara: mhm
24/02/2022, 15:19 - Tara: looked at lab 3 btw it doesnt look that bad
first part is about splicing
24/02/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: oohhh
24/02/2022, 15:21 - Tara: ok i'll do the tutorial / lab with you
but post lab quiz we do on our own
that ok?
24/02/2022, 15:21 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah eyah
24/02/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: eyah is spelt wrong but if u sound it out it says the same thing
24/02/2022, 15:22 - Tara: eeyaa
24/02/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: lord the 2600lectures are boring
24/02/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: i have like 0 motivation to listen
24/02/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: 😩
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Tara: they are
i stopped attending halfway through
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Tara: which was maybe not a great idea since we only had 13 kids and i sat at the front
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: i kinda wanna just not attend and work on the questions
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: but i'll feel guitlty lol
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Tara: do it
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Tara: read the tutorials
24/02/2022, 15:23 - Tara: theyre more useful
24/02/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i will ask my parents lol
24/02/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: they will just agree with me
24/02/2022, 15:25 - Sandeepti Singh: but i feel the need to get validation lol
24/02/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: oh damn after the tutotiral part 3 and 4 make so much more sense
24/02/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: like it's not actualy guessing but different parts are from the function itself
24/02/2022, 16:47 - Tara: yah
24/02/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
24/02/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: we really should attend tutorials before doing the lab hahh
24/02/2022, 16:47 - Tara: mhm we should
24/02/2022, 16:47 - Tara: but like the graph
24/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: oh my this reminds me of ib maths
24/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: i remember those questions
24/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: asking us about the values of certain parameters
24/02/2022, 16:48 - Tara: of sinusoidal curves
24/02/2022, 16:48 - Sandeepti Singh: oh lol yeah
24/02/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao us going like there has to be a better way than just guessing but not actually looking lecture notes for that way
24/02/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: we really do be dumb occaisionally
24/02/2022, 16:49 - Tara: i dont think we guessed right
you could calculate it from the graph
24/02/2022, 16:49 - Tara: we calculated*
24/02/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: oh we guesstimated
24/02/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
24/02/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: so like we did calculate but it was more like an educated guess?
24/02/2022, 16:51 - Sandeepti Singh: also did u know for huma quizzes apparently it doesn't matter what score u get
24/02/2022, 16:51 - Sandeepti Singh: you just have to compplete it to get the mark which is why they give the answer immidiately
24/02/2022, 16:53 - Tara: oh cool
24/02/2022, 16:53 - Tara: have you finished the homework

24/02/2022, 19:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Like one question was legit just about the for loop
24/02/2022, 19:38 - Sandeepti Singh: But I didn’t have a live script open and panicked lmao
24/02/2022, 19:45 - Tara: Ahhh
24/02/2022, 19:46 - Tara: Ok well 3/5 is good

24/02/2022, 19:47 - Sandeepti Singh: one question where they gave SPB and a word and you had to calculate the samples
24/02/2022, 19:47 - Tara: Ya ok different questions
24/02/2022, 19:47 - Sandeepti Singh: one for loop question
24/02/2022, 19:47 - Sandeepti Singh: i can't remember the other two

26/02/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
26/02/2022, 19:14 - Tara: P1+p2+p3+p4=1
26/02/2022, 19:15 - Tara: Then rewrite that in terms of p1
26/02/2022, 19:15 - Tara: P1+P1/2+P1/3+P1/4=1
26/02/2022, 19:15 - Tara: Solve for P1
26/02/2022, 19:16 - Tara: Find the subsequent values of p2,3,4
26/02/2022, 19:16 - Tara: That's your P(X=X)
26/02/2022, 19:16 - Tara: X=x
26/02/2022, 19:17 - Tara: Sorry P(X=k)
26/02/2022, 19:17 - Tara: Then p(X<=k) is the cumulative sum
26/02/2022, 19:20 - Tara: And then do the same thing for part b
26/02/2022, 19:20 - Tara: P4=p3/2=p2/4
P3=p2/2
P2
Add them up
P2+p2/2+p2/4=1
26/02/2022, 19:21 - Tara: Solve for p2
26/02/2022, 19:21 - Tara: Sub in
26/02/2022, 19:22 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh i see it's like a subin thig
26/02/2022, 19:22 - Tara: How do you always ask me stuff that I didn't really know how to do when I was doing the course damn it /s
26/02/2022, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno why i assumed when they said p1 i thought they meant the probability of 1 happening
26/02/2022, 19:23 - Tara: Phh
26/02/2022, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: so i was like huhhhh where's the 1/4

26/02/2022, 22:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks
26/02/2022, 22:54 - Tara: Oh what

01/03/2022, 17:38 - Tara: no everyone's in one
01/03/2022, 17:39 - Tara: *a breakout room

01/03/2022, 17:43 - Tara: k so task 4
01/03/2022, 17:43 - Sandeepti Singh: we have to find bit rate first
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Sandeepti Singh: then add it to the bitratelist
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: how do you plot stuff on the same graph
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: oh
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: nvm
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: i got the bitratelist
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: it should be 1./spblist
01/03/2022, 17:44 - Sandeepti Singh: yup
01/03/2022, 17:46 - Tara: I don't really understand what we're supposed to do there

01/03/2022, 17:49 - Tara: ooh
01/03/2022, 17:49 - Tara: oh also for task 4 do you mind checking the seed 298 pls
01/03/2022, 17:50 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/03/2022, 17:50 - Sandeepti Singh: wait no there's something wrong for task 4 for me

01/03/2022, 17:51 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme a sec
01/03/2022, 17:52 - Tara: i tried
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Tara: 2*SPB-1:SPB:1280
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Tara: but it doesnt work
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i got it
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Tara: what is it?
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Sandeepti Singh: my god
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Tara: he just resent the thing :/
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Sandeepti Singh: oops no i meant task 4 sorry
01/03/2022, 17:53 - Sandeepti Singh: should give more context
01/03/2022, 17:55 - Tara: First element happens at the sample where the first bit ends
01/03/2022, 17:55 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
01/03/2022, 17:55 - Tara: To get the first sub-sampling point you should move forward by SPB to bring you to the beginning of the first bit then forward by SPB-1 to reach the end of the first bit
01/03/2022, 17:55 - Tara: subsequent bit decisions should be made every spb samples after that
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Tara: condensed it for convenience
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Tara: huh
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Tara: can i see your code pls
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: okay nvm this
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: it work now
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme 1 sec
01/03/2022, 17:56 - Tara: yay
01/03/2022, 17:57 - Tara: so do we just want the start and end bit
01/03/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: like i get what they want
01/03/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: the first time its 2*SPB -1
01/03/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: and then after that we move froward SPB
01/03/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: but i do not know how to code that
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: oh i tried that
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: maybe the end point is wrong?
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: ^
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i treid that too but keep getting it wrong lol
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: what's your end thing
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: point
01/03/2022, 17:59 - Tara: is it also 1280
01/03/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: should u switch 1280
01/03/2022, 18:01 - Tara: wdym
01/03/2022, 18:02 - Tara: also can you check pls
01/03/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: oh sure
01/03/2022, 18:03 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
01/03/2022, 18:03 - Tara: ok coolio same thank you
01/03/2022, 18:06 - Sandeepti Singh: yes i think it has to be
01/03/2022, 18:06 - Sandeepti Singh: if you're still on the lab meeting can't you send that line of code and ask what's wrong cuz ti makes sense to me
01/03/2022, 18:07 - Tara: i have
01/03/2022, 18:08 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/03/2022, 18:08 - Tara: ok it's not 1280
01/03/2022, 18:08 - Sandeepti Singh: huh why not
01/03/2022, 18:08 - Tara: he said so
01/03/2022, 18:09 - Sandeepti Singh: oh cuz you're adding star_ind to it
01/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: asffh
01/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: i wanna ask siyoon but ugh
01/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: we should be able to do this
01/03/2022, 18:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah we should
01/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: what are we missing
01/03/2022, 18:11 - Tara: sample_ind is 1*25
01/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: should it not be 1*1280
01/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: no
01/03/2022, 18:12 - Tara: nvm
01/03/2022, 18:12 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
01/03/2022, 18:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i treid 1280/SPB
01/03/2022, 18:14 - Tara: he said we have 1280 bits
01/03/2022, 18:14 - Tara: but more than 1280 samples
01/03/2022, 18:15 - Sandeepti Singh: why do we have more samples than bits?
01/03/2022, 18:15 - Tara: i dunno
01/03/2022, 18:15 - Tara: but the sample index in the graph is greater than 1280
01/03/2022, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: omg i have tried so many things
01/03/2022, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: this is annoying
01/03/2022, 18:19 - Sandeepti Singh: are we missing something super obvious
01/03/2022, 18:20 - Tara: shenme the fuck
01/03/2022, 18:20 - Tara: so i was taking a look at tutorial 4
01/03/2022, 18:21 - Tara: w h a t
01/03/2022, 18:21 - Tara: we are not stupid
01/03/2022, 18:21 - Tara: this is just stupid
01/03/2022, 18:21 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
01/03/2022, 18:21 - Tara: try this
01/03/2022, 18:22 - Tara: start_ind + SPB + SPB*[1:1280] - 1
01/03/2022, 18:22 - Sandeepti Singh: oh it says success bit i got BER 0
01/03/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: my god why did they expalin it in such a bad manner
01/03/2022, 18:23 - Tara: bruhhh
01/03/2022, 18:23 - Tara: i didnt even
01/03/2022, 18:23 - Tara: i literally copied it from tutorial 4
01/03/2022, 18:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Tara: what was your answer for seed 123
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: omg i forgot
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: tjay we have the tutorials after too
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Tara: cri
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme a sec i'm doing for 20 and seed 249
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: and i got 891291
01/03/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: 891281

01/03/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: and good luck
01/03/2022, 18:32 - Tara: huh vmware deletes my lab work
01/03/2022, 18:33 - Tara: im paranoid im saving stuff from lab 3 onwards on my usb
01/03/2022, 18:33 - Tara: i will share it with you later
01/03/2022, 18:34 - Sandeepti Singh: oh thanks
01/03/2022, 18:34 - Sandeepti Singh: but mine's saved i htink
01/03/2022, 18:34 - Sandeepti Singh: but yes pls do save it just in case
01/03/2022, 18:34 - Tara: if you used vmware then maybe not
01/03/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i did use it
01/03/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: oh dammit i'll check if it's saved after dinner
02/03/2022, 12:04 - Tara: <Media omitted>
02/03/2022, 12:05 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks
02/03/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: hewwooo
02/03/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: do u got a min
02/03/2022, 23:40 - Tara: yes i do
02/03/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: it's python elec 2600 lab
02/03/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: and i am so close yet so far in this one questions and am desparate
02/03/2022, 23:41 - Tara: yes send
02/03/2022, 23:41 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
02/03/2022, 23:41 - Sandeepti Singh: so baically i have the no of trues
02/03/2022, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: i just need to store it in a var
02/03/2022, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: but i can not 😢
02/03/2022, 23:43 - Sandeepti Singh: any ideas
02/03/2022, 23:44 - Tara: can't you do like
02/03/2022, 23:44 - Tara: n_rain = data.groupby('Rain')['Rain'].count()
frequency = n_rain / sum(n_rain)
02/03/2022, 23:45 - Tara: ohhhhh
02/03/2022, 23:45 - Tara: wait
02/03/2022, 23:45 - Tara: nono
02/03/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe i need a way to extrract the row and col i need
02/03/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: like just get the value of row 2 col 2 like matab lol
02/03/2022, 23:46 - Tara: why is false 0?
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: i made it like that
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: if i do .count then false is not 0
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: ah i think i got it
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: yeah it should be count
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Tara: right
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: i was just trying stuff lol
02/03/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: even with count it wouldn't work
02/03/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: like i dunno how to extract the trues var
02/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: data['Rainy'] = (data['Rainfall'] > 0)
n_rainy = data.groupby('Rainy')['Rainy'].count()
print('Relative frequencies:\n', n_rainy / sum(n_rainy))
02/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: dont bother with extracting
02/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: <Media omitted>
02/03/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: omg u have those from last sem?
02/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: ya it was my homework
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: oohhh weird
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: except it's a bit different obvs
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: i think they put ur hw questions into our labs
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh yeah ofc we also have like 3 other parts to it though
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: yep if you need help then i'll probably have a similar answer
02/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: anyway is this working
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah yeah thanks a lot
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: other parts are similar so i'll try my best to work on them first
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Tara: ok
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: i think with this part i should be able to do the rest
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Tara: if you need help i'll be online ofr another hour or so
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: i was just confused about how to store it in a var
02/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks a lot
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: im gonna write an amazing response to the discussion
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: haha no one asked me a question yet
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: what if no one asks me any questins
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: do i just not get a point
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: i asked someone else a question though lol
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: comment on other people's things
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: yah
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: i will converse with ming hei
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: the one dude who talks in class
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh i need to make a friends lol in my tutorial too now lol
02/03/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh
03/03/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: bit
03/03/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 00:07 - Sandeepti Singh: for given i thought i can just divide the days it was seasonx and rained by season x but i get the wrong answer i think
03/03/2022, 00:08 - Sandeepti Singh: actually gimme a sec
03/03/2022, 00:08 - Sandeepti Singh: i think that might be rihgt
03/03/2022, 00:09 - Tara: it does add up to 1 right
03/03/2022, 00:09 - Tara: also yeah this makes sense
03/03/2022, 00:09 - Sandeepti Singh: okay lmao so part 2 3 and 4, i am getting the same answer
03/03/2022, 00:09 - Sandeepti Singh: which can't possibly be right
03/03/2022, 00:09 - Tara: P(A|B)=P(A+B)/P(B)
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lol that's what i'm doing
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Tara: so it should be right
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Sandeepti Singh: wait lemme send u all 3 parts cuz in my mind the logic makes sense but i get the same exact answer for all 3 part
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Tara: except i have no idea what n rainy season is
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Tara: yes pls
03/03/2022, 00:12 - Tara: actually do you mind send the code
03/03/2022, 00:13 - Tara: i can open it on my laptop too
03/03/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh okay sure
03/03/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 00:13 - Sandeepti Singh: this should work
03/03/2022, 00:14 - Tara: ya know i have a dedicated folder for all the code we share with each other hahaha
03/03/2022, 00:15 - Tara: oh wait i dont have the data
03/03/2022, 00:15 - Sandeepti Singh: oh my bad
03/03/2022, 00:15 - Sandeepti Singh: one sec
03/03/2022, 00:16 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 00:17 - Sandeepti Singh: i was so happy cuz i thought i was done for a sec
03/03/2022, 00:17 - Sandeepti Singh: and then cry
03/03/2022, 00:17 - Sandeepti Singh: pls note: when i say cry i didn't actually cry
03/03/2022, 00:17 - Tara: ofc who cries over code
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: ummm moi
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: actually no
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: it's more like aggggghhhh fight me code
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: not cry
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Tara: why do i not have pandas on this
03/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm?
03/03/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: if you're using anaconda u should have pandas right
03/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: ugh
03/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: i dont
03/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: i will fix this
03/03/2022, 00:23 - Tara: pretty sure part c is wrong
03/03/2022, 00:24 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno which one i sent u part c should be n_season_rainy / sum(n_rainy)
03/03/2022, 00:24 - Sandeepti Singh: so the prob that it rained over any day it rained?
03/03/2022, 00:24 - Sandeepti Singh: the question is framed weirdly
03/03/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait i'm printing out the lists individually and i see the problem
03/03/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i see so i'm just dividing it by all days
03/03/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: instead of spring days
03/03/2022, 00:28 - Tara: which part are you talking about
03/03/2022, 00:28 - Tara: oh
03/03/2022, 00:28 - Tara: yah
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i get it
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i think i've almost fixed it
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhh what is it
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: not now lah i have work to do
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: im more invested in this lab
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: tell me
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: how do
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme a sec
03/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: also i cant figure out part c ugh
03/03/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: i was thinking soemthing like this
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: n_season = data.groupby('Season')['Season'].count()
data['Spring'] = ((data['Season'] == "spring") && (data['Rainfall'] > 0))
n_spring = data.groupby('Spring')['Spring'].count()
print('Relative frequencies of the seasons:\n', n_spring )
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: but it has a syntax error
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: where
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: also which part is this
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: c
03/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: && is "and" in python
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: the first line of that is not needed
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: you wrote &&
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: it should be and
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: do i have to replace && to just and
03/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: yeah but it's still wrong lmao
03/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lmaooo
03/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it worked in my head smh
03/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: how else can i get when it rained and was spring
03/03/2022, 00:36 - Tara: there's something wrong with
03/03/2022, 00:36 - Tara: data['Rainy'] = data['Rainfall'] > 0
print(data['Rainy'].count())
03/03/2022, 00:37 - Tara: it says 365
03/03/2022, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah cuz it prints all data its jsut some is true and some is false
03/03/2022, 00:37 - Tara: ya idk why though
03/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it just makes it true or false
03/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: but prints out all the data anyways
03/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: but i don't think the answer is wrong
03/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: it is wrong though
03/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: it's affecting all your other answers
03/03/2022, 00:41 - Sandeepti Singh: no because i want that to be 365
03/03/2022, 00:42 - Tara: ok sorry yeah
03/03/2022, 00:44 - Sandeepti Singh: why won't it lemme do and
03/03/2022, 00:47 - Sandeepti Singh: wait no my part b is wrong
03/03/2022, 00:47 - Tara: huh how come
03/03/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: data['Spring'] = (data['Season'] == 'spring')
n_spring = data.groupby('Spring')['Spring'].count()
print('Relative frequencies of the days it rained:\n', n_spring / sum(n_rainy))
03/03/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i think it should be this instead
03/03/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: number of days that are spring/ total number of days
03/03/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: and so on
03/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: but sum(n_season)=365
03/03/2022, 00:50 - Tara: it's correct
03/03/2022, 00:51 - Tara: oh are you talking about part c
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Sandeepti Singh: wait can i have the code i sent u for part b lol
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Sandeepti Singh: i messed it up too much
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: original?
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: n_season = data.groupby('Season')['Season'].count()
print(sum(n_season))
print('Relative frequencies of the seasons:\n', n_season / sum(n_season))
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: part b is correct
03/03/2022, 00:52 - Tara: part c though
03/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: also your answer gives the frequency of spring not spring rain
03/03/2022, 00:53 - Tara: this
03/03/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: yea yeah i know i dunno why i thought part b was wrong and unnecessary started complicating it
03/03/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: lol
03/03/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: that was for part b for some reason
03/03/2022, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: basically if i find out how to find when its spring and rained then i am done with this lab
03/03/2022, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: so close yet so far
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: ooooooh did it
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: n_season_rain = data.groupby('Season')['Rainy'].sum()
print('Relative frequencies of the rainy day:\n', n_season_rain )
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: ooooooo
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: put this for part c
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: i mean i have one more step oops
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: fuck are you kidding me it was sum>?
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: got over excited
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lmao
03/03/2022, 00:58 - Tara: _SUM_
03/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: i am so mad at myself
03/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: i had a goddamn feeling
03/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: wait
03/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: no
03/03/2022, 00:59 - Tara: yesss
03/03/2022, 01:00 - Tara: u g h
03/03/2022, 01:00 - Sandeepti Singh: just this for part c
03/03/2022, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: print('Relative frequencies of the rainy day:\n', n_season_rain/sum(n_season))
03/03/2022, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no wait
03/03/2022, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: n_season_rain = data.groupby('Season')['Rainy'].sum()
print('Relative frequencies of the rainy day:\n', n_season_rain/ n_season)
03/03/2022, 01:01 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted

03/03/2022, 01:02 - Tara: <Media omitted>
03/03/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i think part c is sum and part d is not sum
03/03/2022, 01:04 - Tara: mhm

03/03/2022, 01:08 - Tara: i think i know why though
03/03/2022, 01:08 - Tara: remember that sunday where efje sid elise and i had cake

03/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: sid and i were talking about you guys
03/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: then disha and her friend walked in
03/03/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: sai?
03/03/2022, 01:09 - Tara: no it was a girl
03/03/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz idk but they have a weird on and off thing
03/03/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nvm not improtant continre
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nvm then
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: and she must have just assumed we were dating
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: huh weir
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: d
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Tara: plus we leave parties (i.e. that one party) early together
03/03/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: why is he talking to disha anyways
03/03/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
03/03/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh is disha is new friend group lol
03/03/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: nvm i'm being uneccessarily curious
03/03/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't like the idea of him telling everyone that he and i dated
03/03/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz that was a mistake on my part
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: which sounds ruder than i intended it to
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: i dunno they probably just had lunch together
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: but you know what i mean right
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: doubt they're friends friends
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: ya
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: aiyah being friends with sid is leading to people just assuming we're dating
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah so many people assume y'alk are dating
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: which is Racist
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
03/03/2022, 01:12 - Tara: because aint nobody assuming him and efje are dating
03/03/2022, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh true and he even asked her out
03/03/2022, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: nobody assumes i;m datin anyone so maybe not entirely racist?
03/03/2022, 01:13 - Tara: they might
03/03/2022, 01:13 - Tara: we just dont know
03/03/2022, 01:13 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh lmao true
03/03/2022, 01:14 - Tara: i need to give off stronger ace vibes
03/03/2022, 01:14 - Tara: you know in high school people would just automatically ship you with people of the same race
03/03/2022, 01:14 - Tara: it's annoying
03/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: how do people just assume these things
03/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: am i overly affectionate towards him
03/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: no
03/03/2022, 01:15 - Tara: we have very tight boundaries
03/03/2022, 01:16 - Tara: im just gonna ask for a peace of mind because it's weird and annoying
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: no ma'am i think they just see a girl and a guy together and assume they're dating
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Tara: when you first met sid you didnt assume we were dating right
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: it's true for a lot of the heterosexual world so it makes sense
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: ofc not
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Tara: ok good
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: i intantly knew he was into sharna
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Tara: i hate people
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Tara: oh yah he liked her back then
03/03/2022, 01:17 - Sandeepti Singh: *except me
03/03/2022, 01:18 - Tara: what now
03/03/2022, 01:18 - Tara: oh

03/03/2022, 01:19 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah

07/03/2022, 12:52 - Sandeepti Singh: okie cuz i'm not hinding but i also don't think it's important cuz it's some guy i don't even know
07/03/2022, 12:52 - Sandeepti Singh: he followed me and he had he/him in his bio so i was like awww nice and let him follow e haha
07/03/2022, 12:52 - Sandeepti Singh: he isn't doing anything werid or of concern anyways

07/03/2022, 13:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Okie
07/03/2022, 17:29 - Sandeepti Singh: plot(x, y,'linestyle','none','o') for this linestyle is -- right?
07/03/2022, 17:29 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i keep trying but it keeps giving me errors for some reason
07/03/2022, 17:29 - Tara: no i think it's dots
07/03/2022, 17:29 - Tara: oh
07/03/2022, 17:29 - Tara: let me check
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i can't figure out the dot line thing
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Tara: oh why do you want a line
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: don't we need it?
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: if we don't then i won
07/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: 't bother
07/03/2022, 17:31 - Tara: also is your graph inverted
07/03/2022, 17:31 - Tara: or is mine just wrong
07/03/2022, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme double check but my understanding is when it's -u(n-12) it comes down at 12
07/03/2022, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: to 0
07/03/2022, 17:32 - Sandeepti Singh: but lemme check lecture notes
07/03/2022, 17:32 - Tara: - is up

07/03/2022, 17:33 - Tara: oh no im wrong
07/03/2022, 17:33 - Sandeepti Singh: yep i double checked and i think i'm right
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: oh no wonder my graph for question 3?4? is wonky
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: gonna change it after i figure out elec2400
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Sandeepti Singh: we can do it together
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nvm do 2400 first
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: later pls
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: yeah thanks
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: actually if youna doesnt help and idk how to actually do it then yes
07/03/2022, 17:34 - Tara: let's do it
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah make up your mind
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: idm either
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: but i might work on it rn either way
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Tara: uh you do it first and i'll work on it with you later
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i really wanna get some of this done
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Tara: oui
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: yep okie
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Tara: we can really only do q1-
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Tara: 4
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: next time let's start together too
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Tara: my 4 key is bad
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: so neither of has to redo?
07/03/2022, 17:35 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz if we get ti wrong we both get ti wrong hahah
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Tara: we drag each other down :)
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Tara: yes
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: but hmm i'm conflicted cuz doing it separately is also good cuz u can double check
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: so u know if u did it wrong
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i was discussing with vignesh for hw 1 2600
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Tara: honestly whenever i get homework i freak out and do it asap
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: one of his entire question was wron
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: and then he just copied mine
07/03/2022, 17:36 - Sandeepti Singh: 😡
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Tara: yeah maybe let's check later instead of doing it together
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Tara: the lab though doesnt matter as much
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah i'm usually like that but i had some other assignments so i put that first
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: and then covid lol
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah wait did u already finish the lab?
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Tara: cant believe you got covid
07/03/2022, 17:37 - Sandeepti Singh: or still wanna work on it turesday
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lol i haven't left home for anything since basically dorm
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Tara: i initially went to just take a look but it was really easy and i finished in 30 minutes
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Sandeepti Singh: i even stopped going on runs
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Tara: sorry

07/03/2022, 17:38 - Sandeepti Singh: where is the justice lol
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Tara: nonexistent
07/03/2022, 17:38 - Sandeepti Singh: eh whatever tbh it isn't that bad
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i feel like if this is the worst symponts aka cold
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: then they should just get everyone vaccinated and open up tbh
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz as long as you're vaccinated it's not that big a deal
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Tara: yeah omg i cant with the population
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Tara: stupid ageing population
07/03/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i didn't think that before but everyone in my fam got well within 2 days

07/03/2022, 17:47 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno what they mean by that
07/03/2022, 17:47 - Sandeepti Singh: imma skip it for now and come back to it
07/03/2022, 17:48 - Tara: oh no i was gonna ask you that
07/03/2022, 17:48 - Tara: dammit i hoped that one of us would know
07/03/2022, 17:48 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
07/03/2022, 17:48 - Sandeepti Singh: i have a guess
07/03/2022, 17:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i can put that down for now
07/03/2022, 17:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i might hit up my peer mentee who i got along with and requested to follow me on insta to double check
07/03/2022, 17:49 - Sandeepti Singh: she's also doing 1200
07/03/2022, 17:49 - Sandeepti Singh: but she's y1

07/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: ye
07/03/2022, 18:10 - Tara: bye*
07/03/2022, 18:17 - Tara: ok so question
doesn't -10-0 need to be 0
07/03/2022, 18:17 - Tara: because your 24-30 is 0
07/03/2022, 18:19 - Sandeepti Singh: no i assumed that u(n) was 1 until it was brought down at 12
07/03/2022, 18:19 - Sandeepti Singh: and then since there's no command given after 24 i assume it stays at what 24 was
07/03/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not too sure about this though
07/03/2022, 18:22 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm okay i agree with before 0 it's should be 0
07/03/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/03/2022, 18:24 - Tara: oh no dammit i thought your argument was sound
07/03/2022, 18:24 - Tara: lemme ask siyoon
07/03/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i looked at all graphs in lecutre
07/03/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: and they're all 0 until 0
07/03/2022, 18:28 - Sandeepti Singh: then from 0 they're assumed to be 1
07/03/2022, 18:28 - Tara: ah
07/03/2022, 18:28 - Tara: ok
07/03/2022, 18:29 - Sandeepti Singh: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nu6xxq61io

07/03/2022, 18:29 - Tara: bye

08/03/2022, 11:46 - Tara: Bruh we're talking about stack and queue in computer organisation
Maybe we should've taken this before comp 2011
08/03/2022, 11:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh but I loved stack and queue so much
08/03/2022, 11:47 - Sandeepti Singh: It was the easiest part of 2011
08/03/2022, 11:48 - Sandeepti Singh: I know for a fact that I got that question right on my final cuz the concept is so cool
08/03/2022, 11:48 - Sandeepti Singh: But yes agreed. I feel like comp 2011 stuffs in so much without giving us the time to get to those new concepts
08/03/2022, 11:49 - Tara: Most of this course is on computer memory 
Would have been so helpful with pointers and memory allocation
08/03/2022, 11:49 - Tara: Oh lmao I don't think I fully got it
08/03/2022, 11:49 - Tara: Now I will

08/03/2022, 11:50 - Tara: Indeed
08/03/2022, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I failed c++ so bad
08/03/2022, 11:50 - Tara: Or if we know someone who took comp2012 they can send us stuff
08/03/2022, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: I mean I didn’t it was my highest grade but only cuz the others were worse
08/03/2022, 11:50 - Tara: Actually omg we can still access the comp2011 qebsite
08/03/2022, 11:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Uhummm sid

09/03/2022, 15:27 - Sandeepti Singh: okie i'll payme it to u

09/03/2022, 15:27 - Sandeepti Singh: yes agrred
09/03/2022, 15:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i have sai this several times
09/03/2022, 15:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i am a strong advocate for its name change
09/03/2022, 20:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Yo it’s so weird
09/03/2022, 20:56 - Sandeepti Singh: My 2600 lab is basically what we’re doing in 1200
09/03/2022, 20:56 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s on bit errors when message is transmitted through channel as a result of noise
09/03/2022, 20:59 - Tara: I know right
Whenever I see stats in the 1200 lecture I wanna send it to you and be like omg you're doing this
Then I realise you literally have the same materials
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i think adding lab instead of doing programming in hw is much better
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: lab is much more difficult than hw questions imo
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Tara: Ya I agree
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Tara: I don't think I did great in the programming part of the honework
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Tara: Homework
09/03/2022, 21:00 - Sandeepti Singh: but it's so time consuming i wanna cry
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: but it's also kinda fun
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Tara: Idk though because I never got a grade for the python questions
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Tara: I wanna take math2411 so I can learn R
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: ? they mark your paper really well though? cuz for me they put down exactly where i lost the 2 marks and why
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Tara: Or is it math2421 I don't remember
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i mean i don't agree with it cuz i got the exact same answer
09/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: officially hate the ta
09/03/2022, 21:02 - Tara: In the feedback they just gave ticks or whatever for the maths questions
09/03/2022, 21:02 - Tara: We had to submit them separately
09/03/2022, 21:02 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait the hw you sent me has python questions too?
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: or does it only have math ones
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Tara: Just maths
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Tara: It says "do the python thing" but doesn't give you the tasks
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Tara: How many labs do you have
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
09/03/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: a lab every week
09/03/2022, 21:04 - Tara: Ah
09/03/2022, 21:04 - Tara: Any project?
09/03/2022, 21:04 - Sandeepti Singh: with kinda  the same amount of effort as comp2011
09/03/2022, 21:04 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm not that i know of
09/03/2022, 21:05 - Tara: Yiketh that's quite a bit
09/03/2022, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah : (
09/03/2022, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: i think i spend more time on 2600 lab than 1200
09/03/2022, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: actually yea 2600 is my course with the highest workload this sem
09/03/2022, 21:07 - Tara: Ok well let me know if you need help
09/03/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: oh thanks
09/03/2022, 21:09 - Tara: I may have found my entire elec3120 course on geeks for geeks
09/03/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhhh lucky
09/03/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: poisson means fish lol
09/03/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: why was his surname fish
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Fishtribution!
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: ahah
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Tara: None of my friends appreciate this
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i do
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Because they are not as funny as me
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: am i not your friend :(
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Thank you you're my only real friend
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: absolutely i am
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i am making a sticker out of that
09/03/2022, 21:10 - Tara: In IB I made this our maths GC name
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Tara: And someone fuckin changed the name
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Like a hoe
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Tara: (Sorry)
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: lmaiii
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: oooo*
09/03/2022, 21:11 - Tara: I'm gonna conduct a test in the sane chat
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Time to weed out the fake friends /s
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: lol sure
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm all for it
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: fewer competitors
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Ma'am competitors for what
09/03/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: friendship
09/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: You have interesting ideals re friendship
09/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: But I also agree
09/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: Everyone should compete to be my friend /s
That's why they keep asking at parties who my favourite person is
09/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: Seriously though why is that the one question I 100% get asked
09/03/2022, 21:14 - Tara: Tbh what else do you ask
09/03/2022, 21:16 - Tara: right efje is out
09/03/2022, 21:16 - Tara: this is probably the most narcissistic thing i've done
09/03/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: haha i'm sure you've done more narcissistic things
10/03/2022, 00:17 - Sandeepti Singh: hellooo
10/03/2022, 00:17 - Sandeepti Singh: are u awake
10/03/2022, 00:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm done with everything i have a teeny questions and was wondering if u did it last year
10/03/2022, 00:19 - Tara: Hello
10/03/2022, 00:19 - Tara: I was reading about Saint Andrew
10/03/2022, 00:19 - Tara: Soi am definitely free
10/03/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: haha who dat
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: First apostle
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm sc or do u want the code? i only have a doubt in the very very last part of the hw
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: His skull is in st Andrews
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: i think everything else works
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: Patsy sent me an article to proceed
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhh why do they have his skull
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: Proofread
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Tara: Because Christian people are insane
10/03/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: actually i went to sri lanka and their main attraction is a temple where they have the Buddha's tooth
10/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: It started secreting oil at one point
10/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: Like bro
10/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: That's probably not even his skull
10/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: SC mayhaps
10/03/2022, 00:21 - Tara: Also there was a Byzantine empire named Maurice haha
10/03/2022, 00:22 - Tara: Why don't these guys have any descendants
10/03/2022, 00:22 - Tara: So annoying
10/03/2022, 00:22 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/03/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: so i just have to change model[j] to bit
10/03/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: and the comment above is the hint she gave
10/03/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: and the end result should be that the orange curve is sorta similar to the blue one
10/03/2022, 00:24 - Tara: Wouldn't it be code_lengths[j]
10/03/2022, 00:24 - Tara: Because otherwise models would be constant
10/03/2022, 00:24 - Sandeepti Singh: the last comment right before is the thing that they had put before and we have to change
10/03/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah that makes sense lemme try that
10/03/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: model[j] = geom.pmf(code_lengths[j],0.1)
10/03/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: this is what i have but i get the same constant curve
10/03/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: 😢
10/03/2022, 00:28 - Tara: What's 0.1 again
10/03/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: that the probability of error
10/03/2022, 00:29 - Tara: What's part b
10/03/2022, 00:30 - Tara: Also what can we do with the mean value
10/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah i dunno? she mentioned it in lab hint
10/03/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: and i wrote it down
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: . What probability distribution describes the number of transmissions required until the message is successfuly transmitted?  ------> this is geometric right?
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz they left it up to us to decide which one to use and i thought it was this
10/03/2022, 00:32 - Tara: Ya should be
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: actually it's really late if ur tired and have to sleep you can go for it
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: this isn't due until friday and i'll double check with vignesh cuz he says he'll do it tmr
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Yeah I'm sorry I wanna sleep now
10/03/2022, 00:33 - Tara: I'll help you tomorrow

10/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: i just moslty wanted to check if you'd done this before
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: since you haven't it's cool and i'll ask vignesh
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Tomorrow I'll check my old homework and get back to you
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh okay thanks
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Sandeepti Singh: good night
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: I was lying on my bed reading about the collapse of the western Roman empire
10/03/2022, 00:34 - Tara: And also Saint Andrew
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: oh interesting
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i was too busy with other stuff in the morning so i couldn't study so I'm just trying to catch up on some work
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: Ah ok
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Tara: Don't stay up too late
10/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i stg i am done with everything i need to do for the next like 2 weeks except elec 2600 practice
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: and that's just reducing my motivation to do anything
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it's so annoying
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Tara: Don't forget we also have an elec1200 midterm in two weeks
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Tara: Tbh though
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Tara: Dunno how to revise for it
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah but tbh i'm pretty up to date on lectures slides cuz of quizzes
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: and that
10/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: have u done any of the reference book questions?
10/03/2022, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: are there any reference book questions?
10/03/2022, 00:37 - Tara: No and yes but they're irrelevant
10/03/2022, 00:37 - Tara: They're too complicated compared to the ones we get
10/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh okay good?
10/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: bad that we don't hace practice questions
10/03/2022, 00:38 - Sandeepti Singh: but good that i don't have more work lol
10/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: okay for real good night now
10/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: Indeed
10/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: Also Efje and Youna didn't laugh at my joke so they're gone /s
10/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: I joke idc it's a lame joke that only you and sister appreciate
10/03/2022, 00:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
10/03/2022, 09:47 - Tara: You deleted this message
10/03/2022, 11:59 - Tara: pretty sure you have to do something like models[j]=geom.pmf(code_lengths[j], mean = mean, p = 0.1)
10/03/2022, 11:59 - Tara: do you mind sending me your script
10/03/2022, 11:59 - Tara: im gonna test some stuff out
10/03/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh sure gimme a sec
10/03/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/03/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: hopefully this is the most updated version
10/03/2022, 12:22 - Tara: hhh im sorry idk what to do
10/03/2022, 12:23 - Tara: i dont get the task
10/03/2022, 12:23 - Tara: sorry
10/03/2022, 12:28 - Sandeepti Singh: oh it's okay
10/03/2022, 12:28 - Sandeepti Singh: it's so annoying cuz all the other parts were so long and i got them soon but this part is legit just one line of code and i keep getting it wrong : (
10/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: there are too many words
10/03/2022, 12:29 - Tara: and i dont like it
10/03/2022, 12:30 - Sandeepti Singh: haha agreed
10/03/2022, 12:30 - Sandeepti Singh: but basically the aim is to improve the graph and make the theoretical one closer to the empirical one
10/03/2022, 12:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll keep trying random stuff haha
10/03/2022, 14:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg we got back our scores for 1200
10/03/2022, 14:48 - Sandeepti Singh: I did so bad omg
10/03/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: But it’s like last time where no one got 5? Class mean is 2.3
10/03/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: How is our class that bad
10/03/2022, 14:49 - Tara: huh
10/03/2022, 14:49 - Tara: ok still above average idm

10/03/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: How did I get 3 wrong
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: But ugh it may be like last time where no one got 5 cuz they had marked one question wrong
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: How what’s ur class mean???
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Tara: maybe
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Tara: probably
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Tara: 2.3
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Tara: but the highest score is 5
10/03/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooohh
10/03/2022, 14:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm I did shit but eh last time will compensate for this time hahah
10/03/2022, 16:06 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
10/03/2022, 16:07 - Tara: oh bruh
10/03/2022, 19:23 - Sandeepti Singh: I have a question from the lab
10/03/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: The q was if u have the right value for a you will always reduce the rate of bit error
10/03/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: And it was true fade
10/03/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: False
10/03/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: What do you think the answer will be
10/03/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
10/03/2022, 19:26 - Tara: False
10/03/2022, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh yay same
10/03/2022, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I was like it’ll just amplify noise
10/03/2022, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: If there’s too much noise
10/03/2022, 19:35 - Sandeepti Singh: But then I was worried I overthought
10/03/2022, 20:07 - Tara: <Media omitted>

11/03/2022, 17:44 - Tara: i think it's better to be formal than informal

12/03/2022, 15:19 - Sandeepti Singh: haha why are u looking at 1200s final already
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Tara: wanted to see if i could find questions related to what we've covered so far
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: for me i'm glad i took 2600 and 1200 at the same time cuz they actually are dependent on each in some ways ahahah
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Tara: and there are none
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh were u practicing for the midterm?
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: HHAHA
12/03/2022, 15:20 - Tara: gnop
i initially wanted to see the elec2400 midterm questions
12/03/2022, 15:21 - Tara: then i wanted to see if i had downloaded 1200 papers
12/03/2022, 15:21 - Tara: yeah ik my train of thought is all over the place
12/03/2022, 15:21 - Tara: and im gonna get back to 2400 now bye
12/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: actually sidenote
i think the midterm is just gonna cover up to lecture 11
12/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: since a final paper has a question on lecture 12 content
12/03/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: yep they mentioned it already
12/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: they did??
12/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: yup
12/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: also i assumed cuz initially they only released lecture notes up until 11
12/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: whoops
12/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: yup just checked they mentioned it in an announcent

12/03/2022, 15:27 - Tara: omg you sent that and i misread it as spicy
12/03/2022, 15:28 - Tara: python libraries are so funny
12/03/2022, 15:28 - Tara: why is there one called beautiful soup
12/03/2022, 15:28 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah they are
12/03/2022, 15:28 - Tara: did you know python was named after monty python
12/03/2022, 15:30 - Tara: pandas is cute
beautiful soup is weird
seaborn is random and i assumed it was named after someone like the dude who discovered seaborgium
12/03/2022, 15:30 - Tara: wait lmao that's seaborg
12/03/2022, 15:30 - Sandeepti Singh: or maybe someone into percy jackson
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: sfehrkjghj i just assumed seaborg was a marine scientist even though he literally discovered an element
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: how dare he not go into marine science
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: with a name like that
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: you cant be named seaborg and not have people think you're in marine biology or something
12/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: exactly

13/03/2022, 11:37 - Tara: But in your case pls increase the quantity generally
13/03/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: The sad fact if I had infinity stones is I’d probably just give myself A+ in all classes
13/03/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Maybe take over the world but dunno for sure yet lol
13/03/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: 7 hours is great enough

15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: she's doing that thing where she thinks its easy so she's zooming through them
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: and assuming we understand
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: but i'm dumb
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: so pls exaplina
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: omg that question is so easy
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Tara: Ohh I finally understand the stupid Y/X thing
15/03/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: why did she make it sound difficult lol
15/03/2022, 15:45 - Tara: I was wondering why she said 1.6
15/03/2022, 15:45 - Tara: It's just 2-0.4
15/03/2022, 15:45 - Tara: Cry
15/03/2022, 15:45 - Tara: Ok here we go
15/03/2022, 15:46 - Sandeepti Singh: oh this is our assignment question right
15/03/2022, 15:46 - Tara: Yep
15/03/2022, 15:46 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no nvm they have given pe0 and pe1 here so it's kinda different
15/03/2022, 15:46 - Tara: Oh huh I did this question in a past paper
15/03/2022, 15:46 - Tara: I think
15/03/2022, 15:47 - Tara: (I've only done one haha)
15/03/2022, 15:47 - Sandeepti Singh: haha i usually leave past paper until the end
15/03/2022, 15:47 - Sandeepti Singh: it's like a test for me lol
15/03/2022, 15:49 - Sandeepti Singh: the solution they gave us for 2600 has a mismatch in the number of brackets
15/03/2022, 15:49 - Sandeepti Singh: and it's killing me
15/03/2022, 15:51 - Tara: Ok literally who uses the triangle ratio
15/03/2022, 15:51 - Tara: Basically why have I never used this
15/03/2022, 15:51 - Tara: This would have been great
15/03/2022, 15:52 - Tara: In the tutorial.
15/03/2022, 15:52 - Tara: ?*
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: for the lab for 2600 i mean
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Tara: Ya
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Tara: That's annoying
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i was so happy when i saw the hint/solution thing and wanted to finish it asap
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Tara: Brackets are a bitch in general
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: and voila le brackets are preventing me from ticking it off of the todo list
15/03/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
15/03/2022, 15:55 - Tara: Hhhhhh
15/03/2022, 15:55 - Sandeepti Singh: "whatever" hahaha

15/03/2022, 15:55 - Tara: Oh my
15/03/2022, 15:57 - Tara: I hate this triangle rule
15/03/2022, 15:57 - Tara: Idk why
15/03/2022, 15:58 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
15/03/2022, 15:59 - Tara: That lil bitch ass Pythagoras making things harder for us /hj
15/03/2022, 16:00 - Tara: I would have done really well in an ancient society simply because I love the phrase "ignorance is bliss"
15/03/2022, 16:00 - Tara: He discovered maths and now I have to use my brain
15/03/2022, 16:00 - Tara: Hate him
15/03/2022, 16:00 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA
15/03/2022, 16:00 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah instead of the apple it should have been the tree

15/03/2022, 16:01 - Tara: Omg exactly
15/03/2022, 16:01 - Sandeepti Singh: on his head

16/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: oh do u have the code for question 3c
16/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i wanna redo it with the lines but can't seem to find the code
16/03/2022, 21:53 - Tara: ohhhhh
16/03/2022, 21:53 - Tara: for a second i thought i submitted that
16/03/2022, 21:53 - Tara: how did you get the lines
16/03/2022, 21:54 - Tara: n = 1:50;
s_n = 0.85.*(1-(0.9.^(n+1)));

plot(n, s_n, 'o');
xline(21);
yline(max(s_n)*0.9);

xlabel('n');
ylabel('s(n)');
title('Step response, s(n)');
16/03/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: just use stem function
16/03/2022, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: instead of doing plot(x,x(n))
16/03/2022, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: do stem(x,x(n))
16/03/2022, 21:55 - Tara: yooo
16/03/2022, 21:55 - Tara: that is nice
16/03/2022, 21:55 - Sandeepti Singh: that peer mentee told me about it lol

16/03/2022, 21:55 - Tara: ml
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: why is she more competent than us
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: we're supposed to be good at this
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Sandeepti Singh: she was very incompetent for the rest of it
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: ok cool
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i think we did okay about the question
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Sandeepti Singh: s
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: i think so too
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: hey did you see the new canvas discussion
16/03/2022, 21:56 - Tara: idk my thoughts on romantic love
16/03/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i haven't done it yet
16/03/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: or seen it
16/03/2022, 21:59 - Tara: because on one hand i have a criteria for a partner
on the other hand love is important
however
16/03/2022, 21:59 - Tara: how do i say this
16/03/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not feeling too well today

16/03/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: my blood pressure's low
16/03/2022, 22:00 - Tara: it's already 10 anyway
16/03/2022, 22:00 - Tara: o
16/03/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: it was like 100/64
16/03/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: which isn't too low
16/03/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: but a little low
16/03/2022, 22:01 - Sandeepti Singh: oh question for 2600 was it literally just similar questions to hw or were there a lot of other questions too
16/03/2022, 22:01 - Tara: the former
16/03/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: oh okay good
16/03/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: most of the hw questions were easy
16/03/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: but ugh i hate mcq cuz tiny error and i'll loose all the marks
16/03/2022, 22:02 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh okay lemme see the huma discussion
16/03/2022, 22:03 - Tara: i dunno man
your test is open book
16/03/2022, 22:03 - Tara: ours was not
16/03/2022, 22:03 - Tara: MCQ is easy trust me
16/03/2022, 22:03 - Tara: no silly mistakes
16/03/2022, 22:04 - Tara: i only got one question wrong there
16/03/2022, 22:04 - Sandeepti Singh: okay
16/03/2022, 22:04 - Sandeepti Singh: thabks
16/03/2022, 22:05 - Tara: ok got it
it's very theoretical
16/03/2022, 22:05 - Tara: haha
16/03/2022, 22:06 - Tara: and if it happens idk what im gonna do because what if they dont meet the criteria
16/03/2022, 22:06 - Tara: then imma be stuck
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh i despise this question
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Tara: i know right
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Think of one concrete scenario in which your beloved family members are adamant in their disapproval of your possible life-time partner, for whatever reasons, when you believe you have found true love
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: me gay
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Tara: Haha
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: do i come out on the huma discussion question hahahah
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Tara: sis i was thinking the same thing
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Tara: i have no thoughts on this because i am Ace
16/03/2022, 22:07 - Tara: and i am Practical
16/03/2022, 22:08 - Sandeepti Singh: i will probably just use that required reading on difference in marriage for western vs asian parts of the world
16/03/2022, 22:08 - Sandeepti Singh: and older and younger generations
16/03/2022, 22:08 - Sandeepti Singh: to what extent romantic love plays a role in marriages in different cultures ig
16/03/2022, 22:08 - Tara: how do you write 500 words on it ugh
16/03/2022, 22:08 - Tara: time to bs this
16/03/2022, 22:09 - Tara: ok not 500

16/03/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll bs later
16/03/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: it shouldn't be too hard lol

16/03/2022, 22:09 - Tara: and say i do not believe in it
16/03/2022, 22:09 - Tara: i will think of other things to write
16/03/2022, 22:10 - Tara: like what Should be Right

17/03/2022, 14:24 - Sandeepti Singh: He didn’t use that once. He used integration for the whole thing which I understand much better so I’m just gonna do that lol
17/03/2022, 14:24 - Tara: Integration > stupid Pythagoras

17/03/2022, 14:25 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m scared if it comes up in quiz

19/03/2022, 11:12 - Tara: Hein how are you gonna teach then
19/03/2022, 11:12 - Sandeepti Singh: oh we're helpers
19/03/2022, 11:12 - Sandeepti Singh: but when we speak or there's some important info then they are translating i
19/03/2022, 11:12 - Sandeepti Singh: it
19/03/2022, 11:13 - Tara: Ah
19/03/2022, 13:03 - Tara: hey just a reminder for the stupid triangle question
you can use your GDC to find the equation of the lines
19/03/2022, 13:03 - Tara: idk why it only just occurred to me
19/03/2022, 13:03 - Tara: why use desmos when you have stat / list
20/03/2022, 14:05 - Sandeepti Singh: oh question are we allowed to use ipad for looking at the notes for 1200???
20/03/2022, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I kinda converted it to a recursive model in my head lol
20/03/2022, 15:05 - Tara: Oh no I wanted to ask you because idk how to do it
20/03/2022, 15:05 - Tara: Uh I'm not sure sorry
20/03/2022, 15:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm okay I’ll go to the office hour on Monday to double check both of these and tell u?
20/03/2022, 15:05 - Sandeepti Singh: If u want
20/03/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 15:07 - Tara: Ah thank you very much
20/03/2022, 15:08 - Tara: Ya for me idk how I would do it by observation
20/03/2022, 15:09 - Tara: Didn't realise they had x1 in the equation
20/03/2022, 15:12 - Tara: On Tuesday can we go over the past papers without markschemes
20/03/2022, 15:12 - Tara: You deleted this message
20/03/2022, 15:12 - Tara: Because I have questions
20/03/2022, 15:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Sure
20/03/2022, 16:42 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 16:42 - Sandeepti Singh: That’s weird
20/03/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 16:58 - Tara: Doesn't it say P(In = 0)*Q(t-rmin/sigma) which is the left side
20/03/2022, 16:58 - Tara: oh
20/03/2022, 16:58 - Tara: ohh
20/03/2022, 16:59 - Tara: i misread it
20/03/2022, 16:59 - Sandeepti Singh: I am so confused lol cuz for 0 to have an error it should be above the threshold so from r to r max
20/03/2022, 17:01 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 17:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Yup agree
20/03/2022, 17:02 - Sandeepti Singh: D
20/03/2022, 17:03 - Tara: Q(x) = P(X>x)
If it's pe0 then it could be P(X>(T-Rmax)/sigma))?
20/03/2022, 17:03 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah my point exactly
20/03/2022, 17:03 - Tara: im trying to justify their equation ugh i cannot
20/03/2022, 17:03 - Tara: they cant have such a big error
20/03/2022, 17:03 - Tara: we must be misinterpreting it somehow
20/03/2022, 17:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah cuz I thought the values of q are other way around
20/03/2022, 17:04 - Tara: oml
20/03/2022, 17:04 - Tara: i get it
20/03/2022, 17:05 - Tara: so the mean is Rmin
20/03/2022, 17:05 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 17:06 - Tara: P(X>T)=Q(T-mean=Rmin/sigma)
20/03/2022, 17:08 - Tara: i gotta go now
20/03/2022, 17:08 - Tara: byhe
20/03/2022, 17:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Bye haha
20/03/2022, 17:08 - Tara: do you get it though
20/03/2022, 17:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I think so
20/03/2022, 17:09 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Yuppp
20/03/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: So basically they find the other area cuz it ends up being 1- other area
20/03/2022, 17:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Also omg I finally understand that question about finding the graph sn from un
20/03/2022, 17:12 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s literally just transformations
20/03/2022, 17:12 - Sandeepti Singh: I was way overthinking it lol
20/03/2022, 17:14 - Tara: Ja
20/03/2022, 17:18 - Sandeepti Singh: But oh no I think we got a question wrong
20/03/2022, 17:18 - Sandeepti Singh: On the hw
20/03/2022, 17:18 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 17:18 - Sandeepti Singh: And pin = 1
20/03/2022, 17:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I mean I dunno about u but I got it wrong
20/03/2022, 17:23 - Tara: Huh how is that right
20/03/2022, 17:23 - Tara: Rmin=2 and Rmax=1 right
20/03/2022, 17:23 - Tara: -1 and 2 my bad
20/03/2022, 17:24 - Sandeepti Singh: they didn't shift for pin0 (i'm assuming cuz mean should be 0 )
20/03/2022, 17:24 - Sandeepti Singh: and the y intercept is also not changed
20/03/2022, 17:24 - Sandeepti Singh: wait don't tell me if this is how you do it we loose all marks for all the last 3 questions
20/03/2022, 17:24 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz we based it on our diagram
20/03/2022, 17:25 - Tara: Oh maybe
20/03/2022, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: oh dammit
20/03/2022, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: but i also do not understand this
20/03/2022, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: why isn't the yintercept 0.25
20/03/2022, 17:28 - Tara: They didn't take 0.5pe0+0.5pe1 I think
20/03/2022, 17:28 - Tara: Ok bye
20/03/2022, 17:29 - Sandeepti Singh: haha bye we can discuss it later on when u free
20/03/2022, 17:29 - Tara: I don't trust their answers
20/03/2022, 17:29 - Tara: I'm gonna ask Cupid for an explanation
20/03/2022, 17:29 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah i was thinking the same
20/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: either i email tonight but i''d rather just go to office hour
20/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: it's from 10 to 12 tmr
20/03/2022, 17:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i can go after huma
20/03/2022, 18:25 - Tara: Tysm
20/03/2022, 18:25 - Tara: I don't get it though
The threshold is still -1/3 in question 7
20/03/2022, 18:25 - Tara: How is ours wrong
20/03/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i meant if the y-int here didn't change then our equations of lines will be wrong right? so the point they intersect and stuff will be different
20/03/2022, 18:29 - Tara: Where on canvas are the hw answers?
20/03/2022, 18:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno
20/03/2022, 18:29 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe they haven't released it yet
20/03/2022, 18:30 - Tara: Whaziz then
20/03/2022, 18:30 - Tara: Oml I thought this was the homework
20/03/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no lol. it
20/03/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: 's the midterm review they put
20/03/2022, 18:30 - Tara: Ma'am 😭
20/03/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i was just looking at how they did the question differently so our answer is probably wrong?
20/03/2022, 18:31 - Tara: Oh I got this question right
20/03/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: oh so you submitted different hw answer than mine?
20/03/2022, 18:31 - Tara: No
20/03/2022, 18:32 - Tara: I used the same method as in the homework
20/03/2022, 18:32 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm maybe i made a silly calculation error lemme try again
20/03/2022, 18:57 - Sandeepti Singh: omg genuius
20/03/2022, 18:57 - Sandeepti Singh: i was calculating by hand until i suddently remembered you saying this lol
20/03/2022, 18:58 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 18:58 - Tara: sorry no
20/03/2022, 18:59 - Tara: <Media omitted>
20/03/2022, 18:59 - Tara: convenience 👍
20/03/2022, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: hhahah
20/03/2022, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: oml i integrated the lines (using calc though haha)
20/03/2022, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: they're literally triangles
20/03/2022, 19:04 - Sandeepti Singh: i can just use 0.5*base*height
20/03/2022, 19:05 - Sandeepti Singh: i love how dumb i am
20/03/2022, 19:08 - Tara: hahahah same girl
20/03/2022, 19:08 - Tara: im worried that my basic maths skills are disappearing
20/03/2022, 19:08 - Tara: like i keep forgetting how to calculate the area of basic shapes
20/03/2022, 19:09 - Tara: but if you want me to find the integral of anything im your gal (most of the time i still hate integration by parts)
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: I have to relearn integration for elec 2600
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: But it’s open been
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Book
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: And we can google
20/03/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: So I’m just gonna google the integrations if need be lol
20/03/2022, 19:57 - Tara: Hahhaa
20/03/2022, 19:57 - Tara: I also never managed to remenber the inverse trig integrals
20/03/2022, 19:57 - Tara: Probably because they were provided in the formula booklet
20/03/2022, 21:43 - Sandeepti Singh: oh lmao yes i have the formula booklet ready for the midterms
20/03/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: oh also what's up with parity bits? have we done them this year? all the past paper questions have them
20/03/2022, 21:45 - Tara: parity bits are from lecture 13/14 onwards
20/03/2022, 21:45 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh okay good
20/03/2022, 22:33 - Tara: im writing my body paragraph and i decided to write about the cambridge analytica scandal and im so mad at them now 😤
20/03/2022, 22:34 - Tara: poopheads
20/03/2022, 22:34 - Tara: all of them
20/03/2022, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: omg noooo i was also gonna use them
20/03/2022, 22:44 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz of AOC doing that interciew thing with facebook guy
20/03/2022, 22:44 - Tara: omg big brain
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Sandeepti Singh: which was kinda funny
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Sandeepti Singh: plus we just had someone present on it in lang lol
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Tara: fb guy as in mark zuck?
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Tara: hey you can also write about it you know
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Tara: we're in different classes
20/03/2022, 22:45 - Tara: i like the way you think though haahahha
20/03/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: haha cuz we think the same sometimes hhaha?
20/03/2022, 22:46 - Tara: yes
20/03/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: narcicius

20/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: oh girl...
20/03/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
20/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: my paragraph is very angry
20/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: i need to tone it down
20/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: i also kinda went down the republican party rabbit hole
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: omg omg i did the same for my tok
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: and then had to like tone it waayyy down
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Tara: hahahahha
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: but yeah the whole political party thing goes so well with mine cuz i'm doing it on how tech takes away free thought
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Tara: sjefhejkghkjh same
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: kinda like that extra reading about centillion
20/03/2022, 22:48 - Sandeepti Singh: have you read that?
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Tara: is it the week 8 reading
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Tara: then no
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Tara: actually just no
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Tara: havent read it
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i can't remember which week
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Sandeepti Singh: it wasn't too groundbreaking or whatever it was like a rip off 1984
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Sandeepti Singh: but it was very relevant to free thought and tech
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Tara: ah
20/03/2022, 22:49 - Sandeepti Singh: but it's fictional so meh you can't cite it anyways
20/03/2022, 22:50 - Tara: i'll have to read it then i guess
20/03/2022, 22:50 - Tara: aw
20/03/2022, 22:50 - Sandeepti Singh: nah tbh not necessary to read it
20/03/2022, 22:50 - Sandeepti Singh: also for the first time in forever someone replied to my discussion on huma lol
20/03/2022, 22:50 - Tara: ooh finally
20/03/2022, 22:51 - Tara: omg i posted mine
and ming hei replied with something about domestic abuse like sir that is not related to my point
20/03/2022, 22:51 - Tara: what did they say
20/03/2022, 22:51 - Sandeepti Singh: oh they started talking about attachment theory
20/03/2022, 22:51 - Sandeepti Singh: and  same it was NOT related to mine
20/03/2022, 22:51 - Sandeepti Singh: at all
20/03/2022, 22:52 - Sandeepti Singh: had no idea how to reply lol
20/03/2022, 22:52 - Tara: why dont people just make their own separate point instead of replying incorrectly to ours
20/03/2022, 22:53 - Tara: hmm attachment theory is interesting
20/03/2022, 22:53 - Tara: never mind the wikipedia page has 13 chapters
20/03/2022, 22:53 - Tara: ok 9
20/03/2022, 22:53 - Tara: n o
20/03/2022, 22:53 - Tara: 5 at most
20/03/2022, 22:54 - Tara: bye im getting distracted by wikipedia again
20/03/2022, 22:54 - Tara: on my phone i have 8 tabs open

20/03/2022, 23:05 - Tara: mild panic
20/03/2022, 23:19 - Tara: they said to write around 200 words
do you think i can get away with 218
20/03/2022, 23:20 - Tara: you know what's nice about word
they can track your changes
20/03/2022, 23:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah I think so since it’s only the first draft of the first para
21/03/2022, 02:42 - Sandeepti Singh: yo so imma skip the huma lecture tmr lol no way i wake up at 9. i only have two midterms and the last one is on wed so i'll just watch the huma lecture then and take notes on it and stuff
21/03/2022, 08:18 - Tara: Oh ok 
I was also gonna just skip it today because yeah midterms
21/03/2022, 08:25 - Tara: Thanks bro
21/03/2022, 11:08 - Sandeepti Singh: so werid i'm in the office hour but she won't lemme in
21/03/2022, 11:08 - Sandeepti Singh: like it just says host will let u in
21/03/2022, 11:08 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i still don't completely get question 2 from the midterm review
21/03/2022, 11:14 - Tara: Did you manage to get in
21/03/2022, 11:14 - Tara: Maybe she's seeing people individually
21/03/2022, 11:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah asked her the question
21/03/2022, 11:15 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s so easy lol
21/03/2022, 11:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m like eating breakfast now but I’ll draw It out and send it to u in a bit if u want
21/03/2022, 11:15 - Tara: Yes pls
21/03/2022, 11:15 - Tara: Question 2 is the recursion one right
21/03/2022, 11:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah except no need
21/03/2022, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: okay so for that question you want to get x2 in terms of x1
21/03/2022, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: so you just look at the input graph for x1 and transform it
21/03/2022, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: until it looks like x2
21/03/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: there's 2 1s a 0 and 1 so move it to the left by 1
21/03/2022, 12:01 - Sandeepti Singh: and then also add x1 again but move it to the left by 3
21/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: ohh ok
21/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: thank you
21/03/2022, 12:02 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah it;s so easy lol but so hard to get on your own
21/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: ya ugh
21/03/2022, 13:12 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh i was looking the hw solutions and i made a teeny error. for when the value exceeds 85% percent we correctly wrote n=21 but forgot that 0 was included so it's 22 samples in total
21/03/2022, 13:12 - Sandeepti Singh: apart from that we did great on the hw haha
21/03/2022, 13:13 - Tara: ohh
21/03/2022, 13:14 - Tara: yayy
21/03/2022, 13:14 - Tara: wait have the grades been released or did they just release the solution
21/03/2022, 13:14 - Tara: good job us
21/03/2022, 13:16 - Tara: ok yeah solutions are out
21/03/2022, 13:16 - Tara: im feeling good about the midterm now
21/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah they just released solutions
21/03/2022, 13:17 - Tara: at least our graph method works
21/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lol
21/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: we got lucky having the past hw solutions lol
21/03/2022, 13:17 - Tara: yeah omg thank you siyoon
21/03/2022, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: yo at 12 should we just do a group discord call thing?
21/03/2022, 23:09 - Tara: yeah that's what i was thinking
21/03/2022, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: or group whatsapp might be better
21/03/2022, 23:09 - Sandeepti Singh: discord it is
22/03/2022, 09:06 - Tara: Hey you said you haven't watched black mirror
Does that include San Junipero
22/03/2022, 09:06 - Tara: If so you should watch it
22/03/2022, 09:06 - Tara: It fulfills 2/3 Gs
22/03/2022, 09:24 - Tara: also wanna talk about the midterm at 3:30
22/03/2022, 09:35 - Tara: or 4:30 because i feel like im gonna take a nap after the mt
22/03/2022, 09:49 - Sandeepti Singh: I have a midterm from 3:00 to 4:30 so maybe I can do it around 6/

22/03/2022, 09:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
22/03/2022, 09:51 - Sandeepti Singh: I just remember I didn’t watch the whole show because I thought it was so slow

22/03/2022, 17:49 - Tara: Hey do you mind if we meet after dinner today because I've just noticed an error with my 2400 circuit and I gotta fix it
22/03/2022, 17:49 - Tara: Sorry
22/03/2022, 17:50 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah no problem

22/03/2022, 20:11 - Tara: are you gonna do the final papers
22/03/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: no
22/03/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: no use imo
22/03/2022, 20:11 - Tara: there are only 1-2 questions

22/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:24 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:24 - Tara: ok we have different answers for 2e
22/03/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: omg no dum error for 1
22/03/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme redo
22/03/2022, 20:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't think you need to integrate you can just find the area of triangle
22/03/2022, 20:26 - Tara: yeah not sure why i did that
22/03/2022, 20:26 - Tara: ok your question 1
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: that's question one
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Tara: ah ok
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: dunno why i included start and stop bits the first time around lol
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i blame leo
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Tara: also part b
is it not 1010 0110 0111
22/03/2022, 20:28 - Tara: huh
22/03/2022, 20:29 - Tara: hmm i need to reread the question
22/03/2022, 20:30 - Tara: do we have different start / stop bits
22/03/2022, 20:30 - Tara: oh
22/03/2022, 20:30 - Tara: you took SPB=1
22/03/2022, 20:30 - Tara: should be 3
22/03/2022, 20:31 - Tara: also for c ii i thought we needed to find the equation of the equaliser
22/03/2022, 20:32 - Tara: oh no
22/03/2022, 20:33 - Sandeepti Singh: nope i took spb as 3
22/03/2022, 20:34 - Tara: but there are only 2 bits in the frame
22/03/2022, 20:34 - Tara: wait no not 2
22/03/2022, 20:34 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
22/03/2022, 20:35 - Sandeepti Singh: it should be 13 whole frames with 6 bits each
22/03/2022, 20:35 - Sandeepti Singh: times by spb of 3
22/03/2022, 20:35 - Sandeepti Singh: also for q2 part b i'm getting 0.125
22/03/2022, 20:35 - Sandeepti Singh: part e sorry
22/03/2022, 20:37 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:37 - Tara: but youve only got 6 frames in yours
22/03/2022, 20:37 - Sandeepti Singh: i sent a second pic of the right answerr
22/03/2022, 20:37 - Sandeepti Singh: this one
22/03/2022, 20:37 - Sandeepti Singh: 13 frames each with 6 bits
22/03/2022, 20:38 - Tara: but that's 6 frames
22/03/2022, 20:38 - Tara: also i dont think we have 50 bits in 1b
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhhh? i don't get what you mean? i have 13 frames and each frame is multiplied by bits
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Sandeepti Singh: not 6 frames
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Sandeepti Singh: are we talking about different parts?
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: 1b right
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Sandeepti Singh: lol no i thought u were talking about 1 a
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: oml
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Tara: ok 1b
22/03/2022, 20:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i have to redo that cuz i made a silly mistake in 1a the first time around lol
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: but check your 2 part e
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm getting a different answr
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: will do
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: are you saying you needa redo 1b
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: or just 1a
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i didn't find eqautions of both lines cuz area of 1 triangle is the same as the other one
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Sandeepti Singh: just b
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: oh
22/03/2022, 20:40 - Tara: i need to fix 1c ii
22/03/2022, 20:41 - Sandeepti Singh: actually what's wrong with my part 1b?
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Sandeepti Singh: i found 6 bit blocks with 1 as start and 0 as stop
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Tara: wait you got rid of k in c ii
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Sandeepti Singh: right the whole thing is divided by c
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Tara: it's SPB = 3
your block should be longer
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Sandeepti Singh: the values should be correct though
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Sandeepti Singh: omg yeah
22/03/2022, 20:42 - Sandeepti Singh: keep forgetting that spb
22/03/2022, 20:45 - Sandeepti Singh: yup i got the same for the 1b
22/03/2022, 20:45 - Sandeepti Singh: K***
22/03/2022, 20:45 - Tara: 1a
you dont have k in front of y(n) or 0.92y(n-1)
22/03/2022, 20:46 - Sandeepti Singh: they didn't give a value for k though rihgt
22/03/2022, 20:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Sandeepti Singh: so what answer i have is wrong cuz i forgot that you have to divide the whole thing by k
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Tara: but when you're writing it in terms of model 1 you have y(n)=0.92y(n-1)+0.08kx👎
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Tara: ah yeah i think so
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Tara: im gonna check 2e
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lol i said it ages ago
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Sandeepti Singh: that my k disappeared
22/03/2022, 20:47 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Tara: ohhh
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Tara: i thought that was intentional
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: i am not in a mindframe to do these questions rn lmao way too many unnecessary careless errors
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: no no i'm just tired
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: and for some reason i have a new health thing
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: my dad wants me to go get a blood test
22/03/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: this one isparticularly annoying. my fingers are tingling very badly
22/03/2022, 20:51 - Tara: k got the same answer as you for 2e
22/03/2022, 20:51 - Tara: ma'am
22/03/2022, 20:51 - Tara: go please
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Tara: get a blood test i mean
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Tara: ok so are we in agreement with everything else
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Sandeepti Singh: yeahh
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Sandeepti Singh: see what i mean by silly mistake????
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Tara: ok message me if you do the final papers
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Sandeepti Singh: it is often my downfall
22/03/2022, 20:52 - Tara: yes
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Tara: are you getting enough sleep
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: okieee
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: byeee gonna go eat an after dinner snack
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Sandeepti Singh: which is naturally just mushrooms
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Tara: bony apple tea

23/03/2022, 10:59 - Sandeepti Singh: oh also just to confirm --> if the eye is not open enough  --> is rises too fast --> a should be bigger
23/03/2022, 10:59 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh i got that wrong for one question but basically if it's just 0 you don't add/subtract anything
23/03/2022, 10:59 - Tara: oh seriously
23/03/2022, 10:59 - Tara: agh i keep getting that wrong too
23/03/2022, 11:00 - Sandeepti Singh: like question 1 from 2013 midterm
23/03/2022, 11:00 - Sandeepti Singh: the input is 0 0 1 1 ... the answer was y = u(n-2) ....
23/03/2022, 11:00 - Tara: also im just gonna check this because i have forgotten
23/03/2022, 11:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh okay tell me cuz i wanna double check that concept

23/03/2022, 11:05 - Tara: lmaoo
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Sandeepti Singh: more spb = clearer eye diagram
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Tara: i have an idea for most of them
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Tara: but still
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Tara: would like to compare
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme a min to do this cuz i'm worst at visualization questions like this
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Tara: ok
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Sandeepti Singh: like i know the concept but it's so hard to picture in my head
23/03/2022, 11:05 - Sandeepti Singh: ft. math 2111
23/03/2022, 11:06 - Sandeepti Singh: and 2011
23/03/2022, 11:06 - Tara: oh bro i gave up on the math2011 diagrams
23/03/2022, 11:06 - Tara: who draws 3D shapes
23/03/2022, 11:07 - Tara: and expects people to do maths on it
23/03/2022, 11:07 - Sandeepti Singh: ikr
23/03/2022, 11:07 - Sandeepti Singh: when they showeed us that horse shoe shape

23/03/2022, 11:08 - Tara: i feel like most of your uni stories end with "and i walked into my parent's room to lie on the floor" but it's such a mood
23/03/2022, 11:09 - Tara: omg i do the same except in sister's room ✨
23/03/2022, 11:10 - Sandeepti Singh: haha a

23/03/2022, 11:52 - Sandeepti Singh: imagine if i said the wrong thing like the a value thing lol
23/03/2022, 11:52 - Tara: nono you're right i keep not seeing -u(n)
23/03/2022, 11:52 - Tara: and then im like wat
23/03/2022, 11:53 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaa
23/03/2022, 11:58 - Tara: y(8) is 0 for me
23/03/2022, 11:58 - Tara: s(7)-s(3)=1-1=0
23/03/2022, 11:58 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah yeah i got 0 too in my calculatios
23/03/2022, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: lol sorry put the worng thing there
23/03/2022, 11:59 - Tara: 👍
23/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: y(15) i got 0.75
23/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: 1-1+1-0.5+0.25
23/03/2022, 12:02 - Tara: lemme recheck
23/03/2022, 12:02 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah cuz y15-15
23/03/2022, 12:02 - Sandeepti Singh: so - s(0)
23/03/2022, 12:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i guess then 15 = 0.25 and then 16 is 0
23/03/2022, 12:03 - Sandeepti Singh: it was too tedious for me to do lol
23/03/2022, 12:03 - Sandeepti Singh: in the exam i will actully do all the calculations
23/03/2022, 12:03 - Tara: ah for 16 i also got .75
23/03/2022, 12:03 - Tara: huh that doesnt seem right
23/03/2022, 12:04 - Tara: aight
23/03/2022, 12:06 - Sandeepti Singh: yup yup agreed

23/03/2022, 13:20 - Sandeepti Singh: i guess so
23/03/2022, 13:41 - Tara: huh we have our test on canvas

23/03/2022, 13:41 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah which sucks cuz i love the 0 and 1 drawing question
23/03/2022, 13:41 - Tara: which means no triangle question??
23/03/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: but also they may ask you for the BER so you draw it yourself
23/03/2022, 13:42 - Tara: oh yay
23/03/2022, 13:42 - Tara: oh i can already imagine it
23/03/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait 2020 was online
23/03/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: but the question had triangle
23/03/2022, 13:43 - Sandeepti Singh: that is werid 2020 also had draw if input is 1 and input is 0
23/03/2022, 13:43 - Tara: oh did you do the 2020 final paper
23/03/2022, 13:43 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe they want us to draw, take a pic and upload

23/03/2022, 13:45 - Tara: nvm
23/03/2022, 13:45 - Tara: ohh question 8 is not a midterm thing

23/03/2022, 13:45 - Sandeepti Singh: and we talked about 9 and 10
23/03/2022, 13:45 - Tara: my question 9 was very long winded

23/03/2022, 21:12 - Tara: I'm potentially devastated about one question because I know the answer but I might have chosen the wrong option
23/03/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Like a single mcq? If that’s the only thing ur not sure about u should be fine
23/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: I'm also not sure about question 7
23/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: The nanosecond one
23/03/2022, 21:13 - Tara: Like it could be correct but I also could have inverted the whole thing lmao

I'm not sure but I got 1/8
23/03/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Huh maybe they gave us different values cuz I got 16.6 for that

28/03/2022, 12:11 - Sandeepti Singh: I will eventually watch the video
28/03/2022, 15:01 - Tara: hw grade is out
28/03/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: not for me
28/03/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe cuz it's different lecture so they haven't released it for us
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Tara: mayhaps
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: but we should probably get a similar grade
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Tara: i lost 0.5 marks somewhere huh
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Tara: i dunno why
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Tara: question 2
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: for that samples question
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: because n=21
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: 0 needs to be included
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: so it's a total of 22 samples
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: not 21
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Tara: oh i wrote that
28/03/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: is that it or did u loose some additonal 0.5
28/03/2022, 15:04 - Tara: question 2 is the one with the weird graph we couldnt do initially
28/03/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait question 2 i see
28/03/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: i know we did an extra step of writing out s(n) each time
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Sandeepti Singh: what's the mean for u guys?
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Tara: i think i lost 0.5 for the graph
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Tara: 5.2
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: out of?
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Tara: 6
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: oh what
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: that's so high
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: i meant for the whole hw btw
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: the hw is only worth 6?
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Tara: no
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Tara: they gave us grades for each question
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: okay nvm they're releasing the grades for us rn
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: i got a message for q1
28/03/2022, 15:08 - Sandeepti Singh: huh i got 5 out of 6 for q2
28/03/2022, 15:10 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/03/2022, 15:10 - Tara: We submitted the same thing right
28/03/2022, 15:12 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah exact same
28/03/2022, 15:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i have less working out but we weren't required to do that anyways and my graph is using the stem function so it looks better but that's it
28/03/2022, 15:14 - Sandeepti Singh: i think my answer is the same as the suggested answer for that so i'm not sure where i lost the marks tbh
28/03/2022, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: but the mean is like 87/88 % which is way higher than what i thought it would be tbh
28/03/2022, 15:17 - Tara: Wow in total the mean for our class is 78%
28/03/2022, 15:19 - Tara: Is my class dumber than yours
28/03/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: haha i dunno maybe i calculated wrong
28/03/2022, 15:20 - Sandeepti Singh: it is truly annoying how they released the grades
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: The mean for question 7 was 3.3/6
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: So low
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah our class was 87%
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: Bruh
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: q7 was 4.4
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Tara: Good for me I guess
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah dammi
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Sandeepti Singh: t
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: but also the final means will be based on both classes combined though
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: True
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: a bit unfair for the lab questions cuz they're different for both classes
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: but eh
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: Now how are we gonna calculate that
Do we know how many people there are in each
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: at least your class was worse for hw
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: Probably
28/03/2022, 15:23 - Tara: I'll check later
28/03/2022, 15:24 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah too much work lol
28/03/2022, 15:24 - Tara: Anything is better than circuits ugh
28/03/2022, 15:29 - Sandeepti Singh: agreed
28/03/2022, 15:29 - Sandeepti Singh: now why the hell did i pre-enroll for 2400
28/03/2022, 15:30 - Sandeepti Singh: i thought everyone i know took it so it must be a good course
28/03/2022, 15:30 - Tara: It is
28/03/2022, 15:30 - Tara: But not compared to the other elec courses
28/03/2022, 15:30 - Tara: Which don't involve circuits
28/03/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: okay then i'll try taking 2100 lmao
28/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: I'm sorry
Relatively speaking elec2400 is my worst subject this semester
28/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: But I won't do terribly in it
28/03/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhh okay
28/03/2022, 15:31 - Tara: Because unlike 1100 we actually have homework and hence we can practice
28/03/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah what'up with 1100
28/03/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: no hw whatsoever
28/03/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: i genuiely think it's the worst subject in ust
28/03/2022, 15:32 - Sandeepti Singh: of the one's i've taken at least
28/03/2022, 15:33 - Sandeepti Singh: like comp 2011 was hell but at least a hell i dind't do very bad in
28/03/2022, 15:33 - Tara: I'm so mad I legitimately sat next to the elec guy and he was like how's 1100 and I didn't bring up the lack of practice
28/03/2022, 15:33 - Tara: Ugh
28/03/2022, 15:33 - Tara: I need to write this stuff down
28/03/2022, 15:34 - Tara: Ok bye I'm in a lecture

28/03/2022, 15:38 - Sandeepti Singh: wtf lmao our mean is 79.4%
28/03/2022, 15:38 - Tara: This is gonna sound very pretentious but how the heck did I lose marks in MCQ
28/03/2022, 15:38 - Tara: Scuse me
28/03/2022, 15:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i got one mcq wrong
28/03/2022, 15:39 - Tara: Hhhhhhh

30/03/2022, 12:23 - Tara: ugh why is our elec2400 midterm so late
30/03/2022, 12:23 - Tara: 7:30pm-9
30/03/2022, 12:24 - Sandeepti Singh: i will work on it once i get feedback from the paragraph
30/03/2022, 12:24 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz she might want me to change everything
30/03/2022, 12:25 - Tara: hopefully she wont
30/03/2022, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but i had to change my entire EE topic AFTER the first draft was done
30/03/2022, 12:32 - Tara: well your teacher was an idiot
30/03/2022, 12:32 - Tara: plus it's just one body paragraph
30/03/2022, 12:32 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah truee
30/03/2022, 12:32 - Sandeepti Singh: i think i might come up with an outline beforehand
30/03/2022, 12:33 - Sandeepti Singh: then wrtitng the actual thing will take like 2/3 hours
30/03/2022, 12:33 - Sandeepti Singh: and outlines can be adjusted easily
30/03/2022, 13:07 - Sandeepti Singh: yo for the lang techvention thing
30/03/2022, 13:07 - Sandeepti Singh: do we need to come up with an invention or just use an existing one
30/03/2022, 13:08 - Tara: Ours was not completely original
30/03/2022, 13:08 - Tara: At least my part wasn't
30/03/2022, 13:08 - Tara: I don't remember whether my groupmates had the same design
30/03/2022, 13:08 - Tara: But during the presentation I talked about my own "invention"
30/03/2022, 13:09 - Tara: Which was heavily inspired by another invention
30/03/2022, 13:13 - Tara: cleaning out my inbox and look what i found
30/03/2022, 13:13 - Tara: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: the occaisonlly gets me
30/03/2022, 13:14 - Tara: word certificate templates are the best
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Sandeepti Singh: they really are
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Tara: i cant wait for an end of year party so we can print more stuff
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Sandeepti Singh: oh okay
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Sandeepti Singh: our lang prof doens't explain anything
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Sandeepti Singh: last time he told us we have our presentation like two days before our actualy presentation
30/03/2022, 13:15 - Tara: yeah ours wasn't very clear about that too
30/03/2022, 13:16 - Tara: so if i wasnt supposed to find an existing (it's still being tested) invention then oops
30/03/2022, 13:16 - Tara: im gonna ask vinayak if his invention was original
30/03/2022, 14:00 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lmao
30/03/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: I got a not great group this time around
30/03/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz he randomly assigned it and we couldn’t pick it
30/03/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I think they’ll do the work when need be but I don’t really get along with them
30/03/2022, 14:04 - Tara: aw that sucks
30/03/2022, 14:04 - Tara: but at least they wont be useless
30/03/2022, 14:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeahhh
30/03/2022, 14:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Could be worse lol
30/03/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: yo did you do a lab on iris petal lengths in elec 2600?
30/03/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: like a hw related to it?
30/03/2022, 20:09 - Tara: No sorry
30/03/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no damn
30/03/2022, 20:10 - Tara: I'd love to help but I don't seem to be good at the parts you need help with
30/03/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: haha it's okay you have 2400 midterm thurs anywyas
30/03/2022, 20:12 - Sandeepti Singh: haha our level in 2600 coding is about the same??? if i'm stuck you are also stuck haha
30/03/2022, 20:17 - Tara: Yep
30/03/2022, 20:19 - Sandeepti Singh: but i can send the code and if u see any obvious error it may be helpful
30/03/2022, 20:20 - Sandeepti Singh: groups = data.groupby('Class')['Petal length']
for name,group in groups:
    group.hist(bins = 0.2, density = True, label = name, alpha = 0.5, ax = ax)
30/03/2022, 20:21 - Tara: What are you supposed to do
30/03/2022, 20:21 - Sandeepti Singh: this is the code i'm using to plot multiple histograms on the smae graph
30/03/2022, 20:21 - Sandeepti Singh: but sort out the data based on the name of the petal
30/03/2022, 20:22 - Sandeepti Singh: nvm got it hahaha
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: super dumb mistake
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: Ok
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: What was the issue
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks haha
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: u truly are the best rubber duck
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: Thank you
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Tara: And likewise
30/03/2022, 20:23 - Sandeepti Singh: bins can't be a specific integer ... it has to be np.arange thing
30/03/2022, 20:26 - Tara: Ah
30/03/2022, 20:26 - Tara: Ok
30/03/2022, 20:34 - Tara: Also dw about this because I'm just playing on the switch now
30/03/2022, 20:34 - Tara: Revision done
30/03/2022, 20:34 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wow nicee
30/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: ughhh i'm stuck again
30/03/2022, 21:01 - Sandeepti Singh: if u free u wanna try? i wrote out what the suggested answer should be so i have the logic i just need to sort out some dumb bugs
30/03/2022, 21:04 - Tara: Yes
30/03/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: oh lol lemme send
30/03/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 21:38 - Tara: do you have the jupyter file
30/03/2022, 21:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh shit I gave u the python file
30/03/2022, 21:41 - Sandeepti Singh: One sec
30/03/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Does that work???
30/03/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: I should have answers for all parts
30/03/2022, 21:44 - Tara: do you have files without the icloud format
30/03/2022, 21:44 - Tara: because i cant open the xlsx
30/03/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I need to go home to send it
30/03/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Gimme a few minutes
30/03/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: oop just got home
30/03/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: it's totally cool if you don't have time
30/03/2022, 22:34 - Sandeepti Singh: i will figure it out eventually (hopefully hahah)
30/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: still icloud file
30/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: huh why is this happening
30/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: your previous things were fine
30/03/2022, 22:47 - Tara: maybe send it file by file?
30/03/2022, 23:00 - Sandeepti Singh: is the jupiter file fine?
30/03/2022, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: i redownloaded it
30/03/2022, 23:01 - Sandeepti Singh: try it?
30/03/2022, 23:04 - Tara: No
30/03/2022, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: This one also doesn’t work??
30/03/2022, 23:04 - Sandeepti Singh: What does it say
30/03/2022, 23:04 - Tara: Gimme a minute
30/03/2022, 23:19 - Tara: ah yes finally it works
30/03/2022, 23:19 - Tara: is there an excel sheet
30/03/2022, 23:22 - Tara: in the first question why didnt you put np.arange(0, 7, 0.2) instead of (0, 0.72, 0.2)
30/03/2022, 23:22 - Tara: oh
30/03/2022, 23:22 - Tara: 7 isnt included is it
30/03/2022, 23:22 - Sandeepti Singh: yep
30/03/2022, 23:22 - Tara: send pls
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: oh sure
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Tara: why did you change the step from 0.2 to 0.1
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: she suggested us to
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: to make the curve smoother
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Tara: ok
30/03/2022, 23:24 - Sandeepti Singh: it has nothing to do with bin lenght i think
30/03/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 23:25 - Sandeepti Singh: pls tell me this works
30/03/2022, 23:26 - Tara: yep
30/03/2022, 23:26 - Sandeepti Singh: yay
30/03/2022, 23:26 - Tara: so do you want me to just go over your code or do you need help with a specific part
30/03/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yeah sorry part e is wrong for me
30/03/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i can't figure out why
30/03/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: i know how to do f but i need part e to work
30/03/2022, 23:28 - Sandeepti Singh: those variables of f_x_setosa and f_x_virginica won't work and that's what i need for the next part
30/03/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: omg wait i fixed a part of it
30/03/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: new error though lol
30/03/2022, 23:33 - Tara: bruh i hate python why cant it let me read xlsx
30/03/2022, 23:34 - Sandeepti Singh: yo put this for part e
30/03/2022, 23:35 - Sandeepti Singh: omg i think i wrote x.plot instead of ax.plot
30/03/2022, 23:36 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh nice it's plotting
30/03/2022, 23:36 - Tara: oh you really did
30/03/2022, 23:36 - Tara: that's a nice curve
30/03/2022, 23:36 - Tara: ok but why was it giving a float error
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: i typed group intead of group
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: spends 30 min
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: on not writing a s
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Tara: lmaooo i changed that but i thought i messed it up myself
30/03/2022, 23:37 - Tara: but turns out i didnt have the file properly running
30/03/2022, 23:38 - Tara: <Media omitted>
30/03/2022, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: hAHAH
30/03/2022, 23:42 - Tara: hey did you sort out le bday thing
30/03/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: no option. no way i can think that it's only 4 people
30/03/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: so my parents were like there's no way they will come check inside the hotel room
30/03/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: especially cuz only 2 peole are gonna stay over
30/03/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: so it's okay cuz y'all are just visiting
30/03/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: but i get if that's not entirely safe for y'all so if u want we can jsut meet another time
30/03/2022, 23:48 - Tara: fine
i gotta get out of the house
30/03/2022, 23:49 - Tara: i'll tell mother it's at your place because no way she's gonna let me go to a hotel
couldn't lie about efje's bday party because she knows that hall is closed
30/03/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh wow
30/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: hotel restrictions are only gonna be lifted on the 25th
30/03/2022, 23:50 - Tara: so where is it
30/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: north point
30/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: same hotel as her
30/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: we got it for super cheap
30/03/2022, 23:51 - Sandeepti Singh: hyatt centric harbourside hotel
30/03/2022, 23:52 - Tara: what time do we get there
31/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: waitt
31/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: question
31/03/2022, 00:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i need to do this gx = f_x_setosa * p[setosa] + f_x_virginica * p[virginica]
31/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: but i remember we couldn't pick out different things right
31/03/2022, 00:36 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i explained that terribly
31/03/2022, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 00:37 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm ttempted to just hard code it
31/03/2022, 00:38 - Tara: Shenme
31/03/2022, 00:38 - Tara: No dammit it's 12:30
I will talk to you later
31/03/2022, 00:38 - Tara: Is that ok
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah haha gn
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: Goodnight
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: it's due friday
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm gonna hardcode as a placeholder
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: gnnnn
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: I'll look at it first thing in the morning
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: Seriously the elec2400 lecturer is so slow
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: no no it's cool i have until friday
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: So there's no rush
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Tara: For me to write stuff down
31/03/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: oh haha
31/03/2022, 00:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll send u an updated version of my code tonight then
31/03/2022, 00:40 - Tara: Shhhh I always help asap
31/03/2022, 00:40 - Sandeepti Singh: once i try a few thigns to fix it
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Sandeepti Singh: latest version
31/03/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Oui will download tomorrow
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Sandeepti Singh: okieee
31/03/2022, 00:47 - Sandeepti Singh: gn
31/03/2022, 00:51 - Sandeepti Singh: omg i'm dumb i made a teeny mistake lol another file will be coming ur way pls play no attention just sleep
31/03/2022, 01:02 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i looked at my laptip and went so pretty
31/03/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: my mum was concerned and went who?
31/03/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i showed her the graph i plotted in lab 4
31/03/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: she was even more concerned haha
31/03/2022, 08:26 - Tara: Hahaha
31/03/2022, 08:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao I randomly had too much energy last night
31/03/2022, 08:28 - Sandeepti Singh: And spammed
31/03/2022, 08:28 - Tara: I love spam
Keep it up bro
31/03/2022, 09:35 - Tara: so again do you need help with a bit or just want me to check your code
31/03/2022, 09:49 - Tara: bruhhh i just helped someone with eigenvectors and stuff
31/03/2022, 09:49 - Tara: i was too lazy to find the eigenvectors but i did find the eigenvalues and from there it's straightforward
31/03/2022, 09:50 - Tara: but the person hadn't learnt row reduction??
31/03/2022, 09:50 - Tara: they went straight from systems of equations to "you can use matrices to solve these :)" to "find these fuckin complicated POS eigenvalues"
31/03/2022, 09:50 - Tara: american education, everyone
31/03/2022, 09:51 - Tara: let's just throw them to the deep end and be shocked when they don't do well
31/03/2022, 11:01 - Sandeepti Singh: No way??? That’s dumb
31/03/2022, 11:03 - Sandeepti Singh: In the last part to compute gx instead of computing the problem of setosa and virginica a I sort of hardcoded  it after finding out it’s 0.5
31/03/2022, 11:03 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t know if it’s correct or not
31/03/2022, 12:50 - Tara: Yeah it looks right
31/03/2022, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: like you know what i mean that it is correct but i ended up hard coding it
31/03/2022, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: so if the data is changed my answer is wrong
31/03/2022, 12:50 - Sandeepti Singh: but i have no idea how to extract that info and can't be bothered to spend ages on it
31/03/2022, 12:51 - Sandeepti Singh: fucking vignesh won't reply to my messages???? i might need the number of that other guy in 2600
31/03/2022, 12:51 - Tara: Ok do this
31/03/2022, 12:52 - Tara: Where'd you get n_total
31/03/2022, 12:52 - Tara: Did you hard code that too
31/03/2022, 12:53 - Sandeepti Singh: yup hard coded
31/03/2022, 12:53 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think i can just use .sum
31/03/2022, 12:53 - Tara: Just use length
31/03/2022, 12:53 - Sandeepti Singh: oh okay
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Sandeepti Singh: and then what? because fx_setosa has to be multiplied by the first value
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Sandeepti Singh: not the second
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't know how to do that distinction
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Tara: One second just coding it
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh thanks bro
31/03/2022, 12:54 - Tara: You deleted this message
31/03/2022, 12:55 - Tara: # put your code here

n_petals = data.groupby('Class')['Petal length'].count()
petal_prob = n_petals / len(data)

prob_set = petal_prob['Iris-setosa']
prob_vir = petal_prob['Iris-virginica']

gx = f_x_setosa * prob_set + f_x_virginica * prob_vir

plt.show()
31/03/2022, 12:58 - Tara: Haruki Saegusa.vcf (file attached)
31/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: oh thanks i'll try it out in a bit
31/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: and i will probs text haruki if vignesh doesn't reply today
31/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not asking him for answers, i am legit just double checking
31/03/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: dunno what's up with him
31/03/2022, 13:28 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wow thanks that works really well
31/03/2022, 13:28 - Sandeepti Singh: and the code makes total sense
31/03/2022, 13:47 - Sandeepti Singh: oh how was the lab quiz this week?
31/03/2022, 13:47 - Sandeepti Singh: my scores in labs are abyssmal
31/03/2022, 13:51 - Tara: twas ok
31/03/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
31/03/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Like the delay???
31/03/2022, 18:50 - Tara: Sub it in when y=0
31/03/2022, 18:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh so x= 0 and y= 0
31/03/2022, 18:51 - Tara: Yeah sure
31/03/2022, 18:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh thanks that’s easy

01/04/2022, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah she mentioned it to us
01/04/2022, 17:25 - Tara: It's optional
01/04/2022, 17:25 - Tara: Wat
My TA sucks
01/04/2022, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: mentioning counterargument makes for a weaker essay
01/04/2022, 17:25 - Tara: Oh no

01/04/2022, 17:26 - Tara: Oh

04/04/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 18:34 - Tara: Oui oui
04/04/2022, 18:34 - Tara: I'm curious
What're you using 
Doesn't look like vscode
04/04/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i'm using anaconda's jupiter notebook lol
04/04/2022, 18:35 - Tara: Ohh
04/04/2022, 18:35 - Tara: Interesting
04/04/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah why's that interesting that's what we're supposed to use for elec2600 so i stuck with it
04/04/2022, 18:36 - Tara: I didn't bother using it because I was using Google Colab and also I could barely install any packages on vscode
04/04/2022, 18:36 - Tara: But now your girl doesn't have a whitespace so I'm back to using vscode
04/04/2022, 18:37 - Sandeepti Singh: oohh
04/04/2022, 18:38 - Sandeepti Singh: do you want me to send you the data it prints??
04/04/2022, 18:38 - Tara: Just the CSV pls
04/04/2022, 18:38 - Tara: Thank you so much
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i have no idea what a csv is lol
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Tara: It's like an excel file
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah npppp
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Tara: It should be called stocks.csv
04/04/2022, 18:39 - Tara: It's in the zipped file
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Tara: Comma separated file
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Tara: Very funky and easier to use than excel
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Sandeepti Singh: like this? or is that wrong
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Tara: Bless your soul
04/04/2022, 18:40 - Tara: It's perfect
04/04/2022, 18:41 - Tara: I feel like I'm talking about a baby
04/04/2022, 18:41 - Tara: This program is my child
04/04/2022, 18:42 - Tara: A slow child
04/04/2022, 18:42 - Tara: And occasionally annoying
04/04/2022, 18:42 - Tara: But I love it nonetheless
04/04/2022, 18:42 - Sandeepti Singh: haha is that for that sussie thing?
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: Nah I'm just in charge of updating the sheet in my fam
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Sandeepti Singh: oh lmaoo
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: It's painful doing it by hand
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: So I automated it
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: And since no one else has an IDE
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: / python
04/04/2022, 18:43 - Tara: I outsourced it 😌
04/04/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: wow glad you thought of me an outsource candidate
04/04/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: haha i can't think of the word outsource without laughing
04/04/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz as soon as someone says it efje says that thing we learnt in isom
04/04/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: 70% of inefficiencies are a result of outsourcing
04/04/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: but that's actually cool
04/04/2022, 18:58 - Tara: thank god you're part of the 30%
04/04/2022, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
04/04/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 21:42 - Sandeepti Singh: et voila! my new tattoo
04/04/2022, 21:47 - Tara: hahahahaa
04/04/2022, 21:47 - Tara: are you sure you won't see it and start crying
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: no i deliberately made it funny so i won't cry
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Tara: also if you do get it (pls dont) add a lil fin on top
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: all the serious ones were making me cry
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: i am def getting this but i was thinking of adding like a top hat/cowboy hat on the fish
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: efje liked the idea
04/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it was meaninful to me
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: aight
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: on your ankle right
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: wait lemme reread
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: a top hat would be adorable
04/04/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: ikr
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: i kinda wanted a meaningful tattoo instead of just an aesthetic one
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Tara: are you gonna get it coloured in
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: but i wasn't sure what cuz i dind't wanna regret later on
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Tara: would yellow even show up
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think i won't ever hate banana fish and that tattoo is kinda cute
04/04/2022, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: no i think keeping it uncolored is fine
04/04/2022, 21:51 - Sandeepti Singh: more classy
04/04/2022, 21:51 - Tara: so when is this happening
04/04/2022, 21:51 - Tara: and can i come with

04/04/2022, 21:53 - Tara: would that be too much
it's a smol fish
04/04/2022, 21:53 - Tara: you should like get efje to draw it
04/04/2022, 21:53 - Tara: make it more meaningful
04/04/2022, 21:53 - Tara: she is an artiste
04/04/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha yea
04/04/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh i'm so excited though
04/04/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i always wanted one
04/04/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: and my aprents were like no
04/04/2022, 21:54 - Sandeepti Singh: but now my dad is the same as he was with hall

04/04/2022, 21:58 - Tara: i think if i had the opportunity to get one i wouldnt be shut off from it
parents are presumably vehemently against it and im not gonna ask
but it's not something i would actively pursue
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: try jokingly asking?
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i jokingly said it for like 4 years
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Tara: they were very against sister getting a nose piercing or highlighting her hair
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: increasing my seriousness slowly
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Tara: tattoos are not on the table
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: huhhhhh
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: even highlihgt?
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Tara: she did not do either of those things
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Tara: nope
04/04/2022, 21:59 - Sandeepti Singh: my mum asked me randomly if i wanted to highlight back when i was in grade 8/9
04/04/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: bro that's so extra (no offense to your parents) cuz like your sister's old enough to decide lol
04/04/2022, 22:00 - Tara: the day i went "hey can i get my hair straightened" i was very shocked when she said yes
04/04/2022, 22:00 - Tara: this was when she was still in high school
04/04/2022, 22:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh maybe it's dif now?

The USA is one of the few countries that haven't signed the rights of the child
11/04/2022, 09:49 - Tara: why anyone thinks it's a developed country is beyond me
11/04/2022, 09:50 - Tara: this is literally so dumb
it was signed by people in NYC
but the usa didn't sign it?
11/04/2022, 09:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh same. Legit everything I learn of it and I’m like huhhh????
11/04/2022, 10:00 - Tara: the more i read about these laws im like bruh people are useless why are they letting others get away with this
11/04/2022, 10:00 - Tara: child labour who
11/04/2022, 10:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Saw her last 3 lecs on twice the speed
11/04/2022, 10:05 - Sandeepti Singh: So I feel so weird rn
11/04/2022, 10:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Like why is this slowed down
11/04/2022, 10:06 - Tara: oh you're here
11/04/2022, 10:06 - Tara: hello
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Tara: this course may be useless but there have been two references to the good place
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Tara: so im happy about it
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Tara: ugh such a good show
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I attended the whole lec 👉👈
11/04/2022, 10:08 - Tara: shook
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Tara: ive already watched it twice should i rewatch it
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh second one is obv but I don’t pay attention to dates 🥲
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ve also watched it twice haha
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Tara: 1516
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Was this in the reading?
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I think my brain skips past dates lmao
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Tara: no but it's in the slides
11/04/2022, 10:09 - Tara: i think
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Tara: i mean it's in the slides definitely
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Tara: but idk about the reading
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh that’s fine then
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz it’s open book
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Then I’ll make an effort to check slides
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Rn I’m in my bed but what matters is I’m paying attention
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
11/04/2022, 10:10 - Tara: yes im proud of you
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Sandeepti Singh: HAhah
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Sandeepti Singh: How am I gonna be waking up at like 6 when my parents leave
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Sandeepti Singh: They leave on the
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Tue
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Tara: think about your child
11/04/2022, 10:11 - Tara: 12th right

11/04/2022, 10:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao yessss no date questionsssss
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Tara: awwww not on quiz
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually no I agree with u
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Sandeepti Singh: I could have just googled o
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Sandeepti Singh: I guess yeah it’ll be more like basic idea question
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m gonna go through readings again later on
11/04/2022, 10:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Some of the texts were so long
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I highlighted but I always go overboard lmao
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Tara: oh bruh there are gonna be short answer questions too
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Sandeepti Singh: What no way
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Noooo
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Sandeepti Singh: MCs are way better lmao
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 10:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah the good place again
11/04/2022, 10:17 - Tara: These questions are ok
11/04/2022, 10:17 - Tara: Just gotta reread stuff
11/04/2022, 10:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Yaha did u get 3 for the first one
11/04/2022, 10:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Then false
11/04/2022, 10:17 - Tara: I may have skipped the reading for beauty
11/04/2022, 10:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
11/04/2022, 10:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Eh I think it should be okay
11/04/2022, 10:18 - Sandeepti Singh: But yeah re-read some so that it’s fresh in my mind
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: Bruh it really just takes 20 minutes?
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: Very nice
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: An extra 40 minutes to overthink
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: But also yayyyy we can go back and forth
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg could be our demise
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: We can really nail the short answer questions I think
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: MCQ is up to God tbh
11/04/2022, 10:44 - Tara: Nah I'm kidding we'll be fine
11/04/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA did they say if we have to have cam and shit
11/04/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Like how are they invigilating it
11/04/2022, 10:45 - Tara: Not yet
Guess they'll send something out later
11/04/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah makes sense
11/04/2022, 10:46 - Tara: We should like define everything in the readings
11/04/2022, 10:46 - Tara: Make our lives easier
11/04/2022, 10:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I was gonna read all the  supplementary readings but turns out it’s only Peter singer so I’ll just read that
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Tara: Oh so our earlier question was correct
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Tara: ?
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Tara: Peter Singer said it
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah
11/04/2022, 10:51 - Sandeepti Singh: This is the same question just phrased Bette r
11/04/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s more obvious
11/04/2022, 10:52 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh should be add summary or rr on the doc?
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s easier for the quiz
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Tara: Yes
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Tara: Should we take our weeks lectures / readings
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh sure
11/04/2022, 10:53 - Sandeepti Singh: I think u have one extra then so I’ll take Peter singer one
11/04/2022, 10:54 - Tara: Coolio thank you
11/04/2022, 10:55 - Tara: Aw we didn't get the extra points
Forgot about that
11/04/2022, 10:56 - Sandeepti Singh: YwH we’ll do better on essay and the quiz
11/04/2022, 11:04 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 11:04 - Tara: oui we'll have 5 each
11/04/2022, 11:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh nice
11/04/2022, 11:59 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh is the summary ur making too indepth?
11/04/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i think the questions might be more general? oh maybe we can do in-depth but then also highlihgt/bold or just write in the beginning the overarching arguments (especially by cross-referencing it from lecture notes)
11/04/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz like she said the question might be more general and not so specific
11/04/2022, 12:03 - Tara: Yeah I'll edit it later
11/04/2022, 12:03 - Sandeepti Singh: okie thank
11/04/2022, 12:25 - Sandeepti Singh: yo what was ur techvention again
11/04/2022, 12:25 - Tara: brainboard
11/04/2022, 12:25 - Tara: want to see the essay?
11/04/2022, 12:26 - Tara: that's not helpful sorry
a neuroprosthetic used in gaming
11/04/2022, 12:29 - Sandeepti Singh: yes pls
11/04/2022, 12:30 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 12:32 - Tara: hhhh there are so many commas
11/04/2022, 12:32 - Tara: rip wrote disables users instead of disabled
11/04/2022, 12:34 - Tara: the good thing is that i now understand the technology behind it more because of elec
11/04/2022, 12:36 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 12:39 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh liked the idea of neuroprosthetics
11/04/2022, 12:39 - Sandeepti Singh: is it cool if we do soemthing based on it?
11/04/2022, 12:39 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz we just did not have ideas.
11/04/2022, 12:40 - Tara: yeah well just don't focus on gaming
11/04/2022, 12:40 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah yeah neuroprosthetics is so broad we'll do soemthing else
11/04/2022, 12:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i was kinda thinking neuroprothetics for like people who lacked limbs and stufff to begin with
11/04/2022, 12:41 - Sandeepti Singh: but i wasn't sure how to use it to fill a niche
11/04/2022, 12:41 - Sandeepti Singh: but looking at your report it gives me like more of an understanding on what the aim is
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: hello rubber duck
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: what about this
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: neurorposthetics (for a lot of different things ) are battery powered which runs out and surgery needs to be done again to change
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: the battery
11/04/2022, 12:56 - Sandeepti Singh: so what about a techvention to do with battery source where it converts electromagnetic energy to electrical or like basically one that is very very very long or even permanent
11/04/2022, 12:56 - Sandeepti Singh: thank you for listenting haha!
11/04/2022, 12:56 - Sandeepti Singh: does that seem okay?
11/04/2022, 12:57 - Tara: hmm there are non-invasive neuroprosthetics
what prevents you from using those
11/04/2022, 12:58 - Tara: battery again?
11/04/2022, 12:58 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i think for certain uses it has to be places inside the body/brain right
11/04/2022, 12:58 - Sandeepti Singh: like i dunno epilepsy/ parkinson's et
11/04/2022, 12:58 - Sandeepti Singh: c
11/04/2022, 12:59 - Sandeepti Singh: also if u have a device that u just need to put in the body once it will probably also increase the potential applications it has?
11/04/2022, 12:59 - Sandeepti Singh: pls do nitpick this is the origianl idea
11/04/2022, 12:59 - Sandeepti Singh: everyone in my team is meh
11/04/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i found this on wiki
11/04/2022, 13:00 - Tara: https://phys.org/news/2013-02-german-student-electromagnetic-harvester-recharge.html
11/04/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: isn't that too big to work in the human body
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Tara: yes and it takes too long to charge
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: but that's a good literaturate review thing i think cuz neuroprothetics need to be tinyyyyy
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Tara: but it's possible to improve on it
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh nice
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: oh so do you think this could be a good techvention topic?
11/04/2022, 13:02 - Sandeepti Singh: feel free to disagree this is just my first idea
11/04/2022, 13:02 - Tara: do some more research because the biggest issue is that there really isn't enough to make much electricity
11/04/2022, 13:02 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh okay yeah i legit just got this idea but i think time won't be an issue cuz it's in the body the whole time
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: so if it recharges as it is being used then i don't think there's a problme
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i would say the issue is size and biocompatability
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: but thanks so much i'll do more research
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Tara: no, thank you
11/04/2022, 13:03 - Tara: i now have another thing to read haha
11/04/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
11/04/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: tell me if anything interesting comes up
11/04/2022, 13:04 - Tara: ah im just gonna send one more thing
11/04/2022, 13:04 - Tara: https://www.ece.cmu.edu/news-and-events/story/2019/05/rectennas-converting-radio-waves-into-electricity.html
11/04/2022, 13:05 - Sandeepti Singh: no no send me more atricles haha
11/04/2022, 13:05 - Sandeepti Singh: i was also gonna go on research rampage after my lec finishes
12/04/2022, 09:57 - Tara: I'm rewatching fleabag and like every bit of dialogue is like a slap in the face
12/04/2022, 12:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh yes the show is very well written
12/04/2022, 16:40 - Tara: How much of the 1200 homework have you done
12/04/2022, 16:41 - Tara: Do you want to finish it off on Thursday / Friday
12/04/2022, 16:42 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
12/04/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Aight
12/04/2022, 16:42 - Tara: Get well soon

12/04/2022, 18:36 - Tara: Oh right I'll see after this
12/04/2022, 20:14 - Tara: Sorry can't come on Saturday
12/04/2022, 20:15 - Tara: And I guess I can't come this week 🙃
12/04/2022, 20:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahh okay
13/04/2022, 00:16 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 00:17 - Tara: Ok I will have to check tomorrow but I do know I got d=3
13/04/2022, 00:17 - Tara: Also idk how to do part E
13/04/2022, 00:18 - Tara: Ah I'll just check it now
13/04/2022, 00:18 - Tara: Brb
13/04/2022, 00:19 - Tara: Ok so besides b and e we have the same answers
13/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: For part b I took two bit streams
(Data) 111111 (parity) 00010
And changed one bit
(Data) 111011 (parity) 01010 
So d=3
13/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: I'll just take a photo
13/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i wasn't sure how to get d but i think my part e made sense
13/04/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: like i looked at lec 13 pg 9 and copied it
13/04/2022, 00:27 - Tara: So part e
13/04/2022, 00:27 - Tara: Did you just change D3 to 0
13/04/2022, 00:28 - Tara: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 00:28 - Tara: Can you explain it pls
13/04/2022, 00:29 - Sandeepti Singh: oh S2 is 1 so any bit in that whole 2nd column can have an issue
13/04/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: row**
13/04/2022, 00:30 - Tara: Why is the corrected data 0111
Is it cos we don't know where it's wrong in that string
13/04/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: but the first 2 colums's S is 0
13/04/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: so the first two cols are okay
13/04/2022, 00:30 - Sandeepti Singh: so it has to be the 3rd one in the row
13/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: Ok
13/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: That part I get thank you
13/04/2022, 00:31 - Sandeepti Singh: as in the parity bit has the issue
13/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: But not the corrected data
13/04/2022, 00:31 - Sandeepti Singh: not the actual data
13/04/2022, 00:32 - Sandeepti Singh: so the actual data does not change
13/04/2022, 00:32 - Tara: Ah

13/04/2022, 00:39 - Sandeepti Singh: should be fine by day after though. doctor's sick leave was only until tmr so i'm assuming he knew i'd get better by then
13/04/2022, 00:40 - Tara: Yes hopefully
13/04/2022, 00:40 - Tara: Were you the one who almost got your tonsils removed

17/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
17/04/2022, 00:22 - Tara: ✨Maths✨ aka the integral calculator I found online
17/04/2022, 00:22 - Tara: You're welcome
17/04/2022, 00:27 - Sandeepti Singh: 9:30
17/04/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I promise I’ll wake up
17/04/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhaha
17/04/2022, 00:28 - Tara: I hate you for making me wake up at a normal time
17/04/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: If lab is easy like last time then we can do hw after too
17/04/2022, 00:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Or Monday at the latest

17/04/2022, 00:31 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I was like???? Infinityyy is the limit??? Area is infinite
17/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: Today I woke up at like 10:30 so that was a nice balance
17/04/2022, 00:31 - Tara: Yep
17/04/2022, 00:32 - Tara: As much as I like visualising I simply cannot interpret these weird graphs
17/04/2022, 00:32 - Tara: I mean not the area
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Suppose it's gotta converge somewhere
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Anyway
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Tara: You know how to do the rest?
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i dunno why it kept saying divergent when i put it on online calculators
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: watch good shows
17/04/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: arcane
17/04/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Yes one day I will watch it

17/04/2022, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: actually when are u free? i have a doubt in the solution for 1 of last year's questions
17/04/2022, 17:10 - Sandeepti Singh: like the steps are not clear so i don't know how to solve mine
17/04/2022, 17:11 - Sandeepti Singh: spent like 2 hours on that question alone

17/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: Just need to check my homework
17/04/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: first i was confused about the ranges but i figured out that
17/04/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm stuck on what the bounds for my integrals should be
17/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: Oh pls tell me
17/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: I need a refresher
17/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh hahah do you want me to send you this question from last year
17/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not sure how to extrapolate from that to get the bounds
17/04/2022, 18:00 - Tara: From my homework?
17/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
17/04/2022, 18:00 - Tara: Oh it's fine I have it

17/04/2022, 19:08 - Tara: does it make some sense
17/04/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah yeah I was thinking almost the same Boyd Aries
17/04/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Boundaries
17/04/2022, 19:08 - Tara: gr8
17/04/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: I am eating crepes
17/04/2022, 19:09 - Tara: mmm crepes
17/04/2022, 19:09 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah thanks a lot though
17/04/2022, 19:09 - Tara: remember when we went to k11
17/04/2022, 19:09 - Tara: lobster crepe
17/04/2022, 19:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg yes
17/04/2022, 19:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually no cuz I didn’t actually eat it
17/04/2022, 19:12 - Sandeepti Singh: LmO
17/04/2022, 19:13 - Tara: aw yeah
17/04/2022, 19:13 - Tara: delicious though
17/04/2022, 19:13 - Tara: tried kombucha and lobster for the first time
17/04/2022, 19:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeahhh
17/04/2022, 19:46 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll get it next time
17/04/2022, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no the value is 1 between 19 and 20
17/04/2022, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't think it can be
17/04/2022, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: 1
17/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: If you sum up everything else what do you get
17/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: The total should be 1 right
17/04/2022, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: no
17/04/2022, 21:25 - Tara: Oh ok
17/04/2022, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: it's more than 1
17/04/2022, 21:26 - Tara: Even without the 19-20 thing?
17/04/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
17/04/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait no lemme check
17/04/2022, 21:44 - Sandeepti Singh: 19-20 is 1 already
17/04/2022, 21:45 - Tara: How bout everything else
17/04/2022, 21:47 - Tara: This is a terrible way to do it
But if you're confident with the other stuff then you can find the bounds by hand
17/04/2022, 21:48 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nvm i foind it
17/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: Oh yay what is it
17/04/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: the second one should be 1/2
17/04/2022, 21:49 - Tara: And the bounds?
17/04/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: no clue
17/04/2022, 21:49 - Sandeepti Singh: haruki did it by integrating and then differentiation it
17/04/2022, 21:50 - Sandeepti Singh: do you wanna see how he did it it is insanely hard
17/04/2022, 21:50 - Tara: Yes
17/04/2022, 21:51 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
17/04/2022, 21:52 - Tara: I do not le understand
17/04/2022, 21:52 - Tara: Ok but your other integrals

17/04/2022, 21:57 - Tara: Jes
17/04/2022, 22:28 - Sandeepti Singh: last question for a while
17/04/2022, 22:28 - Sandeepti Singh: how does one graph this:
17/04/2022, 22:28 - Sandeepti Singh: 2(x+y)/ (3y^2)
17/04/2022, 22:32 - Tara: <Media omitted>

18/04/2022, 11:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao
18/04/2022, 12:23 - Tara: Do we need to find a cutoff frequency
18/04/2022, 12:23 - Tara: How do we do that
18/04/2022, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: No idea
18/04/2022, 15:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Can we work on it in the night?

19/04/2022, 15:28 - Tara: oh cool
19/04/2022, 15:28 - Tara: i will finish on thursday
19/04/2022, 15:28 - Tara: oh im gonna ask a question during the tutorial
19/04/2022, 15:29 - Tara: how to simplify the product of cosines if one has a phase shift
19/04/2022, 15:29 - Sandeepti Singh: oh my yes pls do
19/04/2022, 15:29 - Tara: if it is possible
19/04/2022, 15:30 - Tara: omg yay cupid is teaching
19/04/2022, 15:35 - Sandeepti Singh: yayyy thank gof
19/04/2022, 15:35 - Sandeepti Singh: god
19/04/2022, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: we did our q1 the same way right
19/04/2022, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: like i think we used a dif method but it ends up being the same?
19/04/2022, 15:36 - Tara: imma just check now
19/04/2022, 15:37 - Tara: i think it's right
19/04/2022, 15:38 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i thinks so too cuz remember i graphed our equations on desmos and got the answrr
19/04/2022, 15:39 - Sandeepti Singh: oh thank god she's expalining it
19/04/2022, 15:41 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not sure if our q2 part b is correct?
19/04/2022, 15:41 - Sandeepti Singh: based on what she explained today
19/04/2022, 15:41 - Sandeepti Singh: but i'll  mark that down for later
19/04/2022, 15:43 - Sandeepti Singh: brooo
19/04/2022, 15:43 - Sandeepti Singh: cos a * cos a simplifies to  1/2(cos(2A)+ 1) ????
19/04/2022, 15:43 - Tara: yeah i did not know that
19/04/2022, 15:43 - Tara: or remember
19/04/2022, 15:43 - Tara: idk
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: hmmm actually i think ours is still correct htough
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Tara: what's the dude on about in the chatbox
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Tara: what was covered in 1100
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Tara: 1100 easier? lies
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Sandeepti Singh: 1010 not 1100
19/04/2022, 15:44 - Tara: oh i see
19/04/2022, 15:46 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao the way i yelled pls don't skip
19/04/2022, 15:48 - Tara: so like
19/04/2022, 15:48 - Tara: the carrier thing
19/04/2022, 15:48 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
19/04/2022, 15:48 - Tara: do we just scale it so the amplitude is 1
19/04/2022, 15:49 - Sandeepti Singh: our amplitude is 1 right
19/04/2022, 15:49 - Sandeepti Singh: like she said our 1/2 cancelled out with the 2
19/04/2022, 15:49 - Tara: that's in the lecture notes
19/04/2022, 15:49 - Tara: our carrier is already 2cos(2pi0.2n)
19/04/2022, 15:50 - Tara: so does that mean when we demodulate it the carrier to mix it with should be cos(2pi0.2n)
19/04/2022, 15:50 - Tara: so in the end we get 1
19/04/2022, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: rn for q4 D i did multiply it by 2cos(2pi0.2n)
19/04/2022, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: so that's why the 1/2 cancelled oit
19/04/2022, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i think our diagram is wrong for that that
19/04/2022, 15:51 - Sandeepti Singh: or maybe just me
19/04/2022, 15:51 - Tara: oh what i got 4
19/04/2022, 15:52 - Tara: sorry 2*
19/04/2022, 15:52 - Sandeepti Singh: actually wait i think i get what u meant here
19/04/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i wanna ask her if the value of carrier given in asssignment will also then be scaled by 2
19/04/2022, 15:53 - Tara: i asked about the thing
19/04/2022, 15:53 - Tara: that thing*
19/04/2022, 15:53 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 15:53 - Tara: she said she just used 2 because it's in the lecture notes and that we should be careful with the assignment
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Tara: and we should get the right amplitude
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Sandeepti Singh: okay i did hear her answer but i didn't understnad
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Tara: im assuming that means amplitude=1?
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Sandeepti Singh: so is our amplitude of 1/2 wrong
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Tara: no that's fine
in demodulation
19/04/2022, 15:54 - Tara: that's where we need to fix the scaling
19/04/2022, 15:55 - Sandeepti Singh: ? so part d is correct?
19/04/2022, 15:55 - Tara: yes it's fine
19/04/2022, 15:55 - Tara: aw damn turns out i have a lab due tomorrow
19/04/2022, 15:55 - Tara: thought it was the 27th
19/04/2022, 15:56 - Sandeepti Singh: oh for 2400
19/04/2022, 15:57 - Tara: yes im gonna ask youna because idk how to do it
19/04/2022, 15:59 - Sandeepti Singh: did she say we have to change it to complex exponentionals?
19/04/2022, 15:59 - Tara: yes??
19/04/2022, 15:59 - Tara: nay
19/04/2022, 15:59 - Tara: i mean yes but oh no
19/04/2022, 15:59 - Tara: we have to convert it
19/04/2022, 16:00 - Sandeepti Singh: so we have to change our question 4?
19/04/2022, 16:00 - Sandeepti Singh: wanna work on it at night then?
19/04/2022, 16:01 - Sandeepti Singh: do ur lab for 2400 first though
19/04/2022, 16:01 - Tara: yep
19/04/2022, 16:01 - Tara: ugh today really is the worst
19/04/2022, 16:04 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah ugh
19/04/2022, 16:04 - Sandeepti Singh: i do not feel confident about question 3 and 4 at all
19/04/2022, 16:04 - Sandeepti Singh: oh this example is similar to assignnment question 4
19/04/2022, 16:05 - Tara: hhhh
19/04/2022, 16:05 - Tara: im just putting x bruh
19/04/2022, 16:05 - Tara: as the scale
19/04/2022, 16:05 - Sandeepti Singh: at least maybe we can covert into complex exponential at the very end
19/04/2022, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: “It is fine”

19/04/2022, 16:30 - Tara: last two questions
19/04/2022, 16:30 - Tara: she'll probably go through them
19/04/2022, 16:43 - Tara: oh we were half right about the received frequencies
19/04/2022, 16:43 - Tara: just need to get rid of the negatives
19/04/2022, 16:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 17:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh okay
19/04/2022, 17:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Do u wanna go over all answers once? Esp q4?
19/04/2022, 17:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Since it’s due Thursday night we can do it wed/Thursday
19/04/2022, 17:06 - Tara: oh my midterm ends at 10

19/04/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: sure
19/04/2022, 17:50 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
19/04/2022, 17:50 - Sandeepti Singh: i have no memory of these doodles
19/04/2022, 17:51 - Tara: wow those lectures really are boring huh
19/04/2022, 17:51 - Sandeepti Singh: haha no this is the required reading
19/04/2022, 17:51 - Sandeepti Singh: like when i'm reading on my own
19/04/2022, 17:52 - Tara: nice doodles
19/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: who the heck said that smh
19/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: i still have not read that reading
19/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: after thursday i will be caught up
19/04/2022, 17:57 - Sandeepti Singh: okie it's a pretty interesting reading. i like dit
19/04/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: it's super easy to understand too
19/04/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: not convulated arguement
19/04/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: s
19/04/2022, 17:58 - Tara: oh i know why i havent read it
i misnamed the bear went over the mountain as the week 7 reading
19/04/2022, 17:58 - Tara: and did not bother changing it
19/04/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: oh loll
19/04/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: question: you're summaries are much more detailed than mine and idk which way is better???
19/04/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: in my mind summary is super like broad cuz if it's a 2/3 sentence question then we probably can't get into detail

20/04/2022, 17:55 - Sandeepti Singh: ikr so extra though
20/04/2022, 17:55 - Sandeepti Singh: did u guys do this in 2600?
20/04/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: this one's on height and weight by gender
20/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: i think so
20/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: i dunno i may just be mixing yours and mine because i vaguely remember something with height and weight and gender
20/04/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh do you have that hw?
20/04/2022, 17:56 - Tara: or maybe it's literally just this graph that made me go yep seems legit
20/04/2022, 17:57 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
20/04/2022, 17:57 - Sandeepti Singh: we love fake memories
20/04/2022, 17:57 - Tara: im gonna eat dinner and see
20/04/2022, 17:57 - Sandeepti Singh: okie
20/04/2022, 17:58 - Tara: bro i hate myself i applied for an internship and they actually got back to me but it's from june to august im gonna have to tell them i can only work from then
20/04/2022, 17:58 - Tara: lmao what if the holiday falls through
20/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: i applied because i was like hey this looks funky but im not gonna get an interview
20/04/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh yeah it would be kinda hard to get it for a few months
20/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: One (1) month
20/04/2022, 17:59 - Sandeepti Singh: my parents keep telling me to do courses instead of internship
20/04/2022, 17:59 - Tara: It's nearly impossible
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Tara: What do you want to do
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: they want me to do AI and web development course instead
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i kinda agree
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't really have the experience to do well at an intersip
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: n
20/04/2022, 18:00 - Sandeepti Singh: hmmm true. it was hard to find for winter cuz of the same reason
20/04/2022, 18:01 - Tara: Few people do
But bro they'll teach you
20/04/2022, 18:02 - Tara: I don't know anything about computer vision but the folks who just called me for an interview are into that
20/04/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: true but my dad talked to friends and they were like better learn first and then get internship for y3
20/04/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh lucky
20/04/2022, 18:02 - Sandeepti Singh: the ones i applied to were adamant about neededing AI or web development and i know neither
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Tara: The internship isn't gonna throw you in the deep end
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Sandeepti Singh: like i mean it def puts me at a disadvantage you know
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe if i spend time learning then it's better?
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Tara: Eh
Do you think Efje knows anything about law
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Sandeepti Singh: no clue though
20/04/2022, 18:03 - Tara: But no she's in like the second round for a law firm internship
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Sandeepti Singh: oh haha that's cuz of her german
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Tara: German but not law
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah true
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Sandeepti Singh: but her job would be more research stuff
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Sandeepti Singh: like nothing too specialised
20/04/2022, 18:04 - Sandeepti Singh: engineering is specialised
20/04/2022, 18:05 - Sandeepti Singh: if i get intership then great but i think i kinda agree with my parents that i should learn the stuff first before rushing into internship
20/04/2022, 18:05 - Tara: She'll learn stuff on the job
Same for an engineering firm 
If they're giving you an interview that means you're not a completely shit candidate
20/04/2022, 18:05 - Tara: Ok anyway 
Do what you think is best
20/04/2022, 22:40 - Tara: in matlab how do you do draw the graph where it's like (17.5, 0.5)

27/04/2022, 23:27 - Sandeepti Singh: But I really need it to exist
27/04/2022, 23:28 - Tara: i dont think it's enough to capture the electricity required

28/04/2022, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i think she graded stuff based on cats
28/04/2022, 23:39 - Sandeepti Singh: as in the final score she gave to the food was in the measure of cats
28/04/2022, 23:39 - Tara: yeah it's very funny
28/04/2022, 23:39 - Tara: and unique
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: haha it is
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: pain to eat with her then
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: we spent like 20 min trying to get a good pic of the food
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Tara: hahahaha
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Tara: sounds like sibling smh
28/04/2022, 23:40 - Tara: she'd rather i _starve_ /s

28/04/2022, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: was in pain for a bit after but absolutely worth it
28/04/2022, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: i was working on 1200 hw and this network is so ugly how do i make it look pretty
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Tara: omg yeah so ugly
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Tara: not me going y e s
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Tara: then no
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Tara: n o*
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/04/2022, 23:43 - Tara: mine is too straight and the length of the lines do not correspond with the actual distance
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: mine is a mess lmao
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Tara: i fuckin hate non 90 degree angles
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i'm done with first two if you wanna compare
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: btw
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Tara: unless they're 180
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha agreed
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Tara: ok
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: angles should only come in 90degree multiples
28/04/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: okie i'll send mine
28/04/2022, 23:45 - Tara: i love how you finish your homework like when im sitting in the dark reading buzzfeed posts
28/04/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: 1  a) 4 b) 0.0473
28/04/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: 2) a) 0.0012 b) 0.3898 c) 1.24 = 2 d) 6.98 = 6 e)they both increase
28/04/2022, 23:46 - Sandeepti Singh: if something is dif i'll send working out?
28/04/2022, 23:46 - Tara: 1 a) 4, b) 0.04734
2 a) 0.2219 b) 0.07797 c) 1.2 -> 2 d) 6.98 -> 7 e) they both decrease
28/04/2022, 23:46 - Tara: well fuck for question 2
28/04/2022, 23:47 - Tara: oh for part e i graphed it
28/04/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/04/2022, 23:47 - Sandeepti Singh: sam
28/04/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
28/04/2022, 23:48 - Tara: <Media omitted>
28/04/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: omg
28/04/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: no
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i misread the prob
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Tara: for part a
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i did it the opposite
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Tara: should be not transmission
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: 0.26 is it does
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Tara: no*
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i got my mistake
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme do it my concept was right i jsut wrote down the question wrong lmao
28/04/2022, 23:49 - Tara: ohh i agree with your thing about part b
28/04/2022, 23:50 - Tara: it makes more sense
28/04/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah my part b seems correct
28/04/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: it's just 2600 lol
28/04/2022, 23:50 - Sandeepti Singh: i think
28/04/2022, 23:51 - Tara: ok part e
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: oh lol
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: i misread e
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: i agree
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: decreases
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaah
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: no
28/04/2022, 23:52 - Tara: wait
28/04/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: the prob that it's active decreases so n goes from 0.26 to say 0.1
28/04/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i graphed it and sent you what it looks like
28/04/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: min and max both shift rightward
28/04/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: so the min and max no. of nodes needed increases
28/04/2022, 23:53 - Sandeepti Singh: but intuitively i feel like it shouldbe the opposite? ???
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: like if less time people are active it should technically mean fewer nodes needed but no clue
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: pls tell me your reasoning haha
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Tara: yeah
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Tara: i messed up
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Tara: i added a slider thing on desmos
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Tara: it shifts right
28/04/2022, 23:54 - Sandeepti Singh: okie so we agree about all parts so far?
28/04/2022, 23:55 - Tara: oh gosh hollup im sorry
28/04/2022, 23:55 - Tara: i need to recheck
28/04/2022, 23:55 - Sandeepti Singh: okie sure
28/04/2022, 23:57 - Tara: yah ok
28/04/2022, 23:57 - Tara: nice
28/04/2022, 23:57 - Tara: 10/10
28/04/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm working on the next two
28/04/2022, 23:57 - Sandeepti Singh: if you happen to be up i'll send it but also we can just check tmr
28/04/2022, 23:58 - Tara: also your graph is good
28/04/2022, 23:58 - Tara: im not 100% sure about the dijkstra's part
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: oh it seems super easy to mess up
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm just doing it now
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Tara: mine is too simple?
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Sandeepti Singh: but so far this hw is much much much eaiser than last tume
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Tara: yeah jeez what's up with that
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Tara: networking is 10/10
28/04/2022, 23:59 - Tara: signals can fudge itself
29/04/2022, 00:00 - Tara: ok i'll be up til 12:30
29/04/2022, 00:00 - Tara: if you're done by then then we can check
29/04/2022, 00:00 - Tara: otherwise goodnight
29/04/2022, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: okieee
29/04/2022, 00:00 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll text u gn at 12:30
29/04/2022, 00:03 - Sandeepti Singh: for the Dijkstra’s part how do you know which note to go next to
29/04/2022, 00:03 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait nvm i think i figured it out
29/04/2022, 00:18 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 00:18 - Sandeepti Singh: but also i have no idea what i'm doing for it
29/04/2022, 00:19 - Tara: oh damn i wasnt wrong
29/04/2022, 00:19 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
29/04/2022, 00:19 - Tara: i have the same answer
29/04/2022, 00:19 - Tara: tomorrow i may look at some more examples
29/04/2022, 00:19 - Tara: to see if we're actually right
29/04/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: yes pls
29/04/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: i am not sure about it at all
29/04/2022, 00:20 - Sandeepti Singh: but is your table also similar to mine?
29/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: yes it's the same
29/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: except i Put infinity where you put a blank
29/04/2022, 00:21 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 00:22 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i'll add the infinity i checked the lec notes and they put infinity
29/04/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: oh step 3 e will not be infinity
29/04/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: you can get there from D
29/04/2022, 00:23 - Sandeepti Singh: so it becomes 3
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: i thought it's infinity from c
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: that's why
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: honestly idk about this algo
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: i've never used it
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: you're probably right
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Tara: but i'm going to look at it again tomorrow
29/04/2022, 00:24 - Sandeepti Singh: okie sure
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll not text the answrs anymore for tonight
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: enjoy pre-sleep time
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: and enjoy sleep
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: i will cherish these five minutes
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: you also enjoy sleep
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: eventually
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i am in a productive mood rn
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: ah wish that was me
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Tara: what are you going to work on
29/04/2022, 00:25 - Sandeepti Singh: no no. i was not productive all day

29/04/2022, 00:26 - Tara: oh
29/04/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: so some of my citations are out of date by it's standard
29/04/2022, 00:26 - Tara: interesting
29/04/2022, 00:26 - Sandeepti Singh: that's why she told me to fix my referencing
29/04/2022, 00:47 - Tara: bruh i hate myself i spent the last twenty minutes listening to keiying
29/04/2022, 00:47 - Tara: listen to her

29/04/2022, 00:48 - Tara: im struggling to believe that she's in music school
29/04/2022, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm almost done with this hw???? why did it take such little time????
29/04/2022, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: no wya???? how did she get in???
29/04/2022, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: did her parents hear
29/04/2022, 00:48 - Tara: i need simran A to come back so i can ask her what the fajrhsrjh is she doing
29/04/2022, 00:48 - Sandeepti Singh: her sing
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Tara: it's easy right
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Tara: it'll make up for homework 2
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but i think means will be very very high
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: so it probs won't make up for hw 2 tbh
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Tara: i have high hopes for us
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Tara: shhh it's only 3%
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: and we can't afford to make any mistakes
29/04/2022, 00:49 - Sandeepti Singh: haha true
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: i promise to sleep now
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: i will not stalk keiying on social media
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: wait one last thing
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: i was looking at her posts
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: and she's either really committed to making her posts seem authentic
29/04/2022, 00:50 - Tara: or she is legitimately writing about Olivia Rodrigo's "Sour"
29/04/2022, 00:51 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 00:51 - Tara: and this happens to be a thing so
29/04/2022, 01:03 - Sandeepti Singh: are you sleeping now lol?
29/04/2022, 09:37 - Tara: Yep
29/04/2022, 10:31 - Tara: Did you finish q4
29/04/2022, 11:48 - Tara: forgive my stream of utter nonsense but i've just found out we have Jain Maggi masala
29/04/2022, 12:18 - Tara: also i redid q4 part b and c
29/04/2022, 12:19 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 12:19 - Tara: q3*
29/04/2022, 12:20 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 12:23 - Sandeepti Singh: no i don't think it's aggregate
29/04/2022, 12:24 - Sandeepti Singh: like see w you just add how far w is from y
29/04/2022, 12:24 - Tara: no you see it from u to y
29/04/2022, 12:24 - Tara: like in row uxy
from w-y it's 1
but in that oclumn it's 2 because uxy is 1+1=2
29/04/2022, 12:25 - Tara: row ux column y*
29/04/2022, 12:25 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh lemme try and redo then
29/04/2022, 12:25 - Tara: x-y* jesus so many mistakes
29/04/2022, 12:25 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme send you the answer i have q4 though
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Tara: yess
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Tara: same
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Sandeepti Singh: haha how did u read it so fast
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Tara: idk i got very excited
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Tara: and just went zoom
29/04/2022, 12:28 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
29/04/2022, 12:49 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 12:51 - Tara: huh
29/04/2022, 12:51 - Tara: lemme show you what i did
29/04/2022, 12:51 - Tara: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 12:52 - Tara: wait a sec
29/04/2022, 12:52 - Sandeepti Singh: also wouldn't going to D from e be 7 not 6
29/04/2022, 12:52 - Tara: that's what im checking
29/04/2022, 12:54 - Tara: AFCE = 5
AFCED = 6

AFCB = 5
AFCBD = 7
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: i went to D from AFED
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Tara: offf
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: but yeah going AFCED will be cheaper
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Tara: ohhh*
29/04/2022, 12:55 - Sandeepti Singh: does it matter if we choose b or E when they're both 5
29/04/2022, 12:56 - Tara: hmm
29/04/2022, 12:56 - Tara: i would go with e tbh
29/04/2022, 12:57 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i went with e but the order ends up being similar
29/04/2022, 12:58 - Tara: AFCB = 5
AFCED = 6
AFCBD = 7
29/04/2022, 12:59 - Tara: that's weird no
29/04/2022, 12:59 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
29/04/2022, 13:00 - Tara: if you chose B arbitrarily that messes up everything
do you need to be aware of the next moves when you make a decision between two equidistant nodes
29/04/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: no idea
29/04/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: but this is my final one
29/04/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
29/04/2022, 13:01 - Tara: ah i made a tiny mistake
29/04/2022, 13:01 - Tara: will fix it
29/04/2022, 13:02 - Tara: well our order is different
29/04/2022, 13:02 - Tara: but it works!
29/04/2022, 13:02 - Tara: yay

03/05/2022, 15:37 - Sandeepti Singh: and my TA didn't like that so i tried to broaden the scope each time
03/05/2022, 15:39 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhh did u want me to comment on pesky grammer stuff? i'm usually terrible at it because i nver see a problem unless it's like really obvious

03/05/2022, 15:42 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah. i took the question to mean u can only mention one of the 3 prompts
03/05/2022, 15:42 - Sandeepti Singh: since i mentioned contemporary tech i tried not to add the other two
03/05/2022, 15:43 - Tara: ah

04/05/2022, 09:20 - Tara: Bro help I had a dream I ate a baby
The texture was like fish but I almost threw up eating the head so I gave it to mother or Simran idk
04/05/2022, 09:20 - Tara: Then I played bowling with people and I won
04/05/2022, 09:23 - Sandeepti Singh: This may be the weirdest dream of yours by far
04/05/2022, 09:24 - Tara: Sis it was so gross
04/05/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Sis I can imagine
04/05/2022, 09:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Ughh nasty
04/05/2022, 09:24 - Tara: The worst part is that whenever people came over to my grandfather's house (because I was living there) I would ask if they tried eating a baby
04/05/2022, 09:25 - Tara: I want to throw up
04/05/2022, 09:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Randomly dreaming about cannibalism
04/05/2022, 09:25 - Tara: The head
It's crunchy
04/05/2022, 09:25 - Tara: Fuck no
04/05/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: My godddd
04/05/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: How are your dreams this vivid?
04/05/2022, 09:26 - Sandeepti Singh: That u remember it was crunchy
04/05/2022, 09:26 - Tara: Lol sorry for potentially ruining your morning
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Tara: It was the skull
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Tara: I didn't exactly question the rest of it
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Tara: But the head......
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Tara: The head!
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Tara: God literally why
04/05/2022, 09:27 - Sandeepti Singh: The first thing I read when I woke up
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m gonna go pretend that your dream didn’t happen
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Tara: Good
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Tara: I will also pretend
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Me this morning
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:28 - Tara: Me having my dream
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Tara: Tbh though
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Tara: In my previous dreams I've seen decapitation
And that was not as bad as this
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I feel like eating would be one step worse
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Ughh lemme go eat breakfast and stuff now
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Bye
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Also good morning
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Tara: Ah yes good morning
04/05/2022, 09:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Never said that to each other
04/05/2022, 09:30 - Tara: When have we both woken up at the same time without calling
04/05/2022, 09:30 - Tara: It's a miracle
04/05/2022, 09:31 - Tara: Oh!! I have just realised why I dreamt about it
I was listening to a podcast about this fella in the 30s who used to abduct children and occasionally eat them
04/05/2022, 09:48 - Sandeepti Singh: Watch nicer stuff before going to sleep
04/05/2022, 09:48 - Tara: I do though
I only listened to the podcast two days ago
04/05/2022, 09:48 - Sandeepti Singh: So u don’t traumatise both of us 🥲
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Tara: Last night I watched spy x family
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Tara: Why can't I dream about that
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Tara: Sorry again
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Sandeepti Singh: BHaha no it’s funny
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Sandeepti Singh: I won’t stop telling people about jr
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Sandeepti Singh: It
04/05/2022, 09:49 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s my new conversation starter
04/05/2022, 09:50 - Tara: Can you also mention the podcast thing because I feel like you won't
04/05/2022, 09:50 - Tara: Well who am I kidding I won't either
04/05/2022, 09:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha I absolutely will not
04/05/2022, 09:50 - Tara: This mild nausea might be from the dream or just general I'm choosing to believe it's the former
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Tara: It's gross I can't eat fish for a while now
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Tara: Oml
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Tara: The serial killer's name was Arthur Fish
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHAHAAHHA
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 09:51 - Tara: Bro 😭😭
04/05/2022, 09:52 - Tara: Never again
04/05/2022, 09:52 - Tara: Good day to you I will go get ready for the day
04/05/2022, 09:55 - Sandeepti Singh: Okie same
04/05/2022, 11:47 - Tara: i have another idea to make it more fancy
the graph changes every time you run it right
and we need to approximate a and k
again, we run a loop to find a and k and see which one produces the lowest MSE
04/05/2022, 11:48 - Tara: this was in a lab iirc
04/05/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh right we did do a lab on mse
04/05/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: if we code it so we get the best fit values of a k each time
04/05/2022, 12:00 - Sandeepti Singh: we can easily equalise it
04/05/2022, 12:01 - Tara: Can't wait to code this bro
04/05/2022, 12:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Same lol
04/05/2022, 12:02 - Sandeepti Singh: I have to finish my 2600 lab today I’m gonna do it early so we can meet earlier for 1200
04/05/2022, 12:03 - Tara: Yeet
04/05/2022, 12:03 - Tara: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 12:03 - Tara: In a good way
04/05/2022, 14:25 - Tara: Bro help I've been waiting for Adhya for 25 minutes
04/05/2022, 14:25 - Tara: We're gonna be late for lunch and we've pushed it back to 2:45 already

04/05/2022, 14:27 - Tara: The only place I can go to is the maritime museum
04/05/2022, 14:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Uh oh
04/05/2022, 14:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Text her?
04/05/2022, 14:27 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno i hate it when people are late
04/05/2022, 14:28 - Tara: You and me both bro
04/05/2022, 14:28 - Tara: Why are we friends with chronic latecomers
04/05/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Ikr smh

04/05/2022, 18:21 - Tara: Ok
04/05/2022, 18:21 - Sandeepti Singh: stuck on one tiny thing
04/05/2022, 18:21 - Sandeepti Singh: yet again
04/05/2022, 18:22 - Tara: Are you sure you're stuck because last time it was correct
04/05/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm sure
04/05/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: i know exactly what's wrong though
04/05/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: my tstd or theoretical std is wrong
04/05/2022, 18:23 - Sandeepti Singh: we're using central limit theory
04/05/2022, 18:24 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: and this is what haruki said
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: you forgot
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: the linear factor
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: for central limit theorem
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: Var = n*sigma^2
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: sigma^2 = Var
04/05/2022, 18:25 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA that's so much stuff i'm sorry
04/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: so just multiply by 30?
04/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: std^2 = variance right
04/05/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
04/05/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: oh square it and then multiply by 30?
04/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: so you found the variance
04/05/2022, 18:27 - Tara: no do ^0.5
04/05/2022, 18:27 - Tara: and divide by 30
04/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: or no
04/05/2022, 18:28 - Tara: divide by 30 then ^0.5
04/05/2022, 18:29 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme try
04/05/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i got it it's times by 30 and then sqrt
04/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: huhhh *30?
04/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: ok
04/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: interesting
04/05/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao i don't get why either tbh
04/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: ok well that's done
04/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: 1200 now?

04/05/2022, 19:51 - Sandeepti Singh: oohh nice
04/05/2022, 19:51 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll also try it out then

04/05/2022, 19:51 - Sandeepti Singh: what's ur ber and energy like?
04/05/2022, 19:51 - Tara: i think it's acceptable
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Sandeepti Singh: isn't ur energy more than before
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Tara: others are getting 700-900
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Tara: someone else got 160 though so idk
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Tara: yes but i think it's still ok
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Tara: if we're going to discuss equalisation
04/05/2022, 19:52 - Tara: at least the ber is small

05/05/2022, 10:26 - Sandeepti Singh: After that is fine then?
05/05/2022, 10:26 - Tara: aw
05/05/2022, 10:27 - Tara: oui
05/05/2022, 10:27 - Sandeepti Singh: I think I have a tutorial from 2:00 to 3:00 but I’m free after
05/05/2022, 10:27 - Sandeepti Singh: And today I’ll probably take Leo on a walk around 6:30
05/05/2022, 10:27 - Sandeepti Singh: But I’m free the rest of the day
05/05/2022, 10:27 - Tara: ok
05/05/2022, 13:35 - Sandeepti Singh: throughput has to be packets per second
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Sandeepti Singh: she mentioned in the tutorial
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Sandeepti Singh: we did that right?
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Tara: yeah
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Sandeepti Singh: okie
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao she's going over hw questions so i meight randomly send u stuff to doublecheck
05/05/2022, 13:36 - Sandeepti Singh: we need a 100% on this one
05/05/2022, 13:37 - Tara: yeet ok
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: they didn't do 6C1 for example 2
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: if we know only one node is sending then we don't do 6C
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: 1
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Tara: huh ok
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Tara: so we remove (5 1)
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Tara: 5c1
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: let's double check the question before we change it though
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz it depends on the specific question
05/05/2022, 13:39 - Sandeepti Singh: we can do it when we meet for 1200
05/05/2022, 13:40 - Sandeepti Singh: if i say any then use 6C1 but if i say particular node then no need
05/05/2022, 13:40 - Sandeepti Singh: cupid said that
05/05/2022, 13:41 - Tara: ohh
05/05/2022, 13:41 - Tara: ok
05/05/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: our part b is particular node
05/05/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: so no 6C1
05/05/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: ie 5C!
05/05/2022, 13:42 - Sandeepti Singh: 5C1
05/05/2022, 13:44 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh for max and min nodes they took the derivative of the efficiency formula
05/05/2022, 13:47 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nvm that doesn't apply to us our questions gives us the efficiency
05/05/2022, 14:04 - Tara: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 14:04 - Sandeepti Singh: email icon with blue hair

05/05/2022, 14:05 - Tara: no
05/05/2022, 14:05 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA geninely is
05/05/2022, 14:05 - Sandeepti Singh: the icon looks smug
05/05/2022, 14:05 - Tara: it does!
05/05/2022, 14:05 - Sandeepti Singh: idk how to descirbe it but it does
05/05/2022, 14:05 - Tara: i have to use it for a project
05/05/2022, 14:06 - Tara: i will immediately delete it after i finish the term
05/05/2022, 14:06 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
05/05/2022, 14:07 - Tara: omg
05/05/2022, 14:07 - Tara: it's coraline
05/05/2022, 14:07 - Tara: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: \omg yes it's the same
05/05/2022, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i have never seen colarine
05/05/2022, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: also
05/05/2022, 14:12 - Sandeepti Singh: sfqs. i'm gonna give cupid such a good rating
05/05/2022, 14:13 - Tara: omg yeah i gave her 10/10
05/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 14:18 - Tara: ❤️❤️ we love her
05/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: how might the TA improve? I don't think it's possible
05/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i hope it doesn't sound like i'm joking
05/05/2022, 14:19 - Sandeepti Singh: because i'm really not haha
05/05/2022, 14:20 - Tara: bro i've been scammed sjfhsdjh
05/05/2022, 14:20 - Tara: you know the lamp i bought
05/05/2022, 14:21 - Tara: so it turns on when the two magnets are near each other right
05/05/2022, 14:21 - Tara: but
it also turns on when i pull the string of the bottom magnet at full length
05/05/2022, 14:34 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh is that bad???
05/05/2022, 14:34 - Tara: yah it doesn't work because of a ""gravitational pull"" like how it's advertised
05/05/2022, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhhh
05/05/2022, 14:39 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m gonna spam u with tattoo ideas now
05/05/2022, 14:39 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 14:40 - Tara: hahaha

05/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: yee minimalist
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: ok question actually
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Yes?
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: does this tattoo have to mean anything
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Absolutely not
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: or are you getting it just like that
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: ok
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Like I wish I had something meaningful
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: Unfortunately I live a life of no meaning 🥲
05/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: fair enough
05/05/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno anything worth meaning to get? Like everything is so fleeting. At least pretty is forever
05/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: no i get that
05/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: that's also part of the reason i dont want one
05/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: because i dont have anything that's stuck with me
05/05/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah same
05/05/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: But I think if I get something pretty it should be fine?
05/05/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Later on if I end up having soemthing meaningful I can always get one more later on
05/05/2022, 15:04 - Tara: ya
05/05/2022, 15:07 - Tara: ok are you ready for 1200
05/05/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh sure
05/05/2022, 15:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I gotta start matlab gimme a min
05/05/2022, 15:08 - Tara: https://hkust.zoom.us/j/97921526830
05/05/2022, 15:29 - Tara: You deleted this message
05/05/2022, 15:31 - Tara: k = 1;
a = 0.3;

rx_temp = [];
rx_temp(1:length(rx_wave)) = 0;

05/05/2022, 16:31 - Sandeepti Singh: hewoooo
05/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: min?
05/05/2022, 16:34 - Tara: is that not a function
05/05/2022, 16:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i treid that
05/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: what does that give
05/05/2022, 16:37 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nevermind i was using the wrong array
05/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: jesus christmas why do i have 7 tasks in canvas no
05/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: w
05/05/2022, 16:38 - Tara: oh btw remember to change homework 3
05/05/2022, 16:39 - Tara: looking for my old answers and i forgot to tell you i accidentally added five fingers instead of four
05/05/2022, 16:39 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: you should type rx_max not tx_max
05/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: because 10 is the transmitted training sequence max
05/05/2022, 16:41 - Tara: btw for the homework
q2b i got 0.07797 
whenever you're free just check against yours
05/05/2022, 16:43 - Sandeepti Singh: oh yep same
05/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: ok gr8 i'll submit mine
05/05/2022, 16:43 - Sandeepti Singh: it's 4 decimals
05/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: oh oops thanks
05/05/2022, 16:43 - Sandeepti Singh: so 0.0780
05/05/2022, 16:44 - Sandeepti Singh: but i did tx_wave_out
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: yeah that's correct then it should be 10
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: rx_max should be 2
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: the second graph not first
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: there is not rx_max
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: oh interesting
05/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: gimme a second
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't know which one it would be
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: what are you trying to find
just rx_max?
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: /min
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: min and min
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: yes
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: so i can calculate c and k
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: just so i can write it in the report
05/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: and maybe it gives me a better k value for the equalisation
05/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: hmm
05/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: ok i'll open matlab and see what i can do
05/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: i got it
05/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: for rx right
05/05/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah like the recieved training sequence
05/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: display(max(rx_wave));
display(min(rx_wave));
05/05/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: where did u add thit?
05/05/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: like which file
05/05/2022, 16:50 - Tara: wave2bs
05/05/2022, 16:50 - Tara: so why does k=threshold not work
05/05/2022, 16:50 - Tara: because it should be similar?
05/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: oh it works nvm
05/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: it increases BER a bit for me though
05/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: still below 2%
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i guess this adds to the code part
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Tara: yay
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Sandeepti Singh: where we used code to get channel paramenters
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Sandeepti Singh: so tiny truly
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhhh i think i know how to make it better
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Tara: do you mind if we call again
05/05/2022, 16:53 - Tara: it'll be easier
05/05/2022, 16:55 - Tara: uhhhhh
05/05/2022, 16:56 - Tara: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 16:56 - Sandeepti Singh: suree clall
05/05/2022, 16:56 - Tara: lollll why is it higher for 10 and 20
05/05/2022, 16:56 - Tara: https://hkust.zoom.us/j/99008016988
05/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: hey did you see the google thing
05/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: if so are you gonna apply
05/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: im gonna
looks cool
05/05/2022, 18:11 - Sandeepti Singh: What google thingy
05/05/2022, 18:11 - Tara: google developer student club lead
05/05/2022, 18:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Did they email about it?
05/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: yepp
05/05/2022, 18:12 - Tara: about an hour ago
05/05/2022, 18:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh lemme apply for it too
05/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: i'll apply tonight
05/05/2022, 18:14 - Tara: hope we get in
05/05/2022, 18:15 - Tara: that's another extra-curricular yay
05/05/2022, 18:15 - Tara: idk about you but 3-4 is enough for me wew
05/05/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh I’ll play in a bit
05/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Play?
05/05/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Apply
05/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: O
05/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: Ok
05/05/2022, 21:11 - Sandeepti Singh: HAhsha sorry
05/05/2022, 22:45 - Sandeepti Singh: question
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: in lec notes they were like var = nstd^2
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: but then in the hw it var = std^2 / n
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Tara: 2600 right
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: when do you use which one
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Tara: o
05/05/2022, 22:46 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lol sorry
05/05/2022, 22:47 - Tara: uh idk ive only seen this
05/05/2022, 22:47 - Tara: im googling it
05/05/2022, 22:47 - Tara: because i forgot which one it is
05/05/2022, 22:48 - Tara: maybe they mistyped it?
05/05/2022, 22:50 - Tara: wait wat
05/05/2022, 22:50 - Tara: did you rearrange it or something
05/05/2022, 22:51 - Tara: im confused
05/05/2022, 22:51 - Tara: variance is sigma^2
05/05/2022, 22:52 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 22:52 - Sandeepti Singh: why are they multiplying by here
05/05/2022, 22:52 - Tara: variance is sigma^2*n = std^2
so sigma^2=std^2/n
05/05/2022, 22:52 - Tara: no one sec
05/05/2022, 22:52 - Tara: im confusing myself
05/05/2022, 22:53 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
05/05/2022, 22:54 - Tara: std = sigma
variance = n*sigma^2
variance = n*std^2

that's right
05/05/2022, 22:54 - Tara: but the homework
05/05/2022, 22:54 - Tara: can i see your equation again pls
05/05/2022, 22:56 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
05/05/2022, 22:56 - Sandeepti Singh: how do i know which one to use
05/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: Uh
05/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: lemme think
05/05/2022, 23:01 - Tara: You deleted this message
05/05/2022, 23:03 - Tara: You deleted this message
05/05/2022, 23:03 - Sandeepti Singh: ? i'm so confused
05/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: IID - sigma^2
ISI - n*sigma^2
sample mean - sigma^2/n
05/05/2022, 23:04 - Tara: but what the hell is the other type of mean
05/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: because when i type in central limit variance the second thing comes up
but when i type sample variance the third comes up
05/05/2022, 23:05 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh
05/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: no that's a lie just the third one comes up for both
05/05/2022, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: ughhh
05/05/2022, 23:06 - Tara: is it  arandom variable thing
05/05/2022, 23:06 - Sandeepti Singh: how do i know when to use what?
05/05/2022, 23:07 - Tara: no
05/05/2022, 23:08 - Tara: honestly
05/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: i feel like you should just only use the second one /n
05/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: because i cannot find a thing that says *n
05/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: or i would ask the prof or haruki
06/05/2022, 00:27 - Tara: Oh uh do you want to proofread each others elec1200 report or nah
06/05/2022, 00:27 - Tara: But hmm what's there to proofread
06/05/2022, 00:27 - Tara: Equations? Idk
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Tara: Also do you know what kekw means
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh sure just general dumb mistakes
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Sandeepti Singh: Nooo
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Tara: O
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Tara: I Google then
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Tara: I was talking to someone and he said kekw
06/05/2022, 00:29 - Tara: Cue confusion
06/05/2022, 00:30 - Tara: Ok it means lol
06/05/2022, 00:30 - Tara: But how did they get that from this
06/05/2022, 00:30 - Tara: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 00:30 - Tara: Anyway when you're done just message me
06/05/2022, 00:30 - Tara: I'm going to bed now though so I'll send mine tomorrow
06/05/2022, 00:32 - Tara: Also bruh mother ordered anti stress pills for the family like ???? I didn't realise everyone was that messed up
06/05/2022, 00:32 - Tara: They're not really effective though and don't let me fall asleep
06/05/2022, 00:33 - Tara: enough thoughts from me goodbye
06/05/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: I might work on mine tmr or Saturday
06/05/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: And then I’ll send it to u
06/05/2022, 00:33 - Tara: Yeah ok
06/05/2022, 00:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Gnnnnn p
06/05/2022, 00:34 - Tara: Goodnight
06/05/2022, 12:01 - Tara: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 12:01 - Tara: i think we have different ways of calculating k?
06/05/2022, 12:07 - Tara: im so paranoid i have a livescript running run_eval 20 times
06/05/2022, 12:25 - Tara: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 12:33 - Tara: oh nvm i rewatched the video
06/05/2022, 12:34 - Tara: about this he said that you can't like extract some information like prop_in.bs = rx_bs and embed it somewhere else like prop_out.bs = tx_bs
06/05/2022, 12:37 - Tara: but to be safe
06/05/2022, 12:37 - Tara: i think what we can do is instead of using rx_temp change it to rx_wave
06/05/2022, 12:37 - Tara: since you get the same answer anyway
06/05/2022, 13:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh we even have the same var names channel min and channel max
06/05/2022, 13:16 - Sandeepti Singh: I will go home and check the code for similarity
06/05/2022, 13:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh yeah smort
06/05/2022, 13:17 - Tara: oh you're on campus i forgot
06/05/2022, 13:17 - Tara: enjoy your counselling appointment and everything else
06/05/2022, 13:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks lol
06/05/2022, 14:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Can I ask you for a favour?
06/05/2022, 14:15 - Tara: Yep go for it
06/05/2022, 14:15 - Sandeepti Singh: It shouldn’t take too long but I don’t have my laptop and I need to run a like of python code
06/05/2022, 14:16 - Sandeepti Singh: scipy.stats.norm.isf
06/05/2022, 14:16 - Sandeepti Singh: One sec lemme do the question lol
06/05/2022, 14:17 - Sandeepti Singh: I also forgot my calculator I’m so dumb
06/05/2022, 14:17 - Tara: Do you want wabbit
06/05/2022, 14:17 - Tara: The GDC app
06/05/2022, 14:17 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh yes lemme download that
06/05/2022, 14:18 - Tara: I have the file I can send it to you
06/05/2022, 14:18 - Tara: Just gimme a few minutes
06/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I mean actually I can just use symbolab for most of it
06/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: You don’t have to if it’s time consiming
06/05/2022, 14:21 - Tara: No it's fine I'm just finishing lunch
06/05/2022, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno how else to do it
06/05/2022, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh I saw shivya adhya and she
06/05/2022, 14:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Dj
06/05/2022, 14:27 - Tara: 2.575829
06/05/2022, 14:28 - Tara: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: Yes that’s it I think
06/05/2022, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Can u do it for the second one too? Same line of code
06/05/2022, 14:32 - Tara: what's isf
06/05/2022, 14:32 - Tara: oh
06/05/2022, 14:32 - Tara: survival function?
06/05/2022, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah
06/05/2022, 14:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh wait for this one you’ll do scipy.stats.norm.sf(root 400)
06/05/2022, 14:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Not isf
06/05/2022, 14:33 - Tara: 2.753*10^-89
06/05/2022, 14:34 - Tara: hmm that's very small
06/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: I would have to do 1-2(x) to that
06/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh wait yeah that’s very smalll
06/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh I forgot the times 0.08
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: sqrt(00*0.08)
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: 400**
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: ?
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: or no
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: idk
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: you tell me
06/05/2022, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
06/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: 0.05479929
06/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Ughhh sorry for making u do it a second time
06/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: Thanks a lot
06/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: so you get 0.8904

06/05/2022, 14:40 - Sandeepti Singh: But it’s still annoying
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Tara: indeed it is
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz i don’t even know if she’ll text me soon
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Sandeepti Singh: I have my appointment from 4and I am a bit hungry now
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Tara: buy a drink?
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Sandeepti Singh: I was supposed to have lunch a
Before vaccine but I forgot
06/05/2022, 14:40 - Sandeepti Singh: So I was like I’ll just have it after
06/05/2022, 14:41 - Sandeepti Singh: But now it’s like ???? I guess I’ll just perish
06/05/2022, 14:41 - Tara: no perish
06/05/2022, 14:41 - Tara: perish her for being late
06/05/2022, 14:41 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm lemme ask her what time she was thinking
06/05/2022, 14:41 - Sandeepti Singh: She can just cancel if it’s 40 minutes late lol
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: yeah bro go eat
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: remember with sanjana we just ate without her
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: well not with
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: re
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: that one time
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: emphasis on one
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Sandeepti Singh: I can’t eat alone
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Sandeepti Singh: My worst nightmare
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: ya you can
06/05/2022, 14:42 - Tara: it's not sad it's just life
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Tara: do not starve
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Tara: video call leo
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Tara: feel less lonely
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Smort
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Tara: i know
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Tara: thank you
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: also i think i have a problem with eating slowly
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: because i got lunch with adhya right
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh she’s done
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: she finished at least ten minutes before me
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: oh bless
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah I have it too
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: finally
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: im definitely slower than you though
06/05/2022, 14:44 - Tara: example: bafang
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh trueee
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Sandeepti Singh: But also u do get more bafang then me
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Tara: hmmmm
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Tara: good point
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Tara: we test this one day
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
06/05/2022, 14:45 - Sandeepti Singh: I eat with efje most days and I think I eat less and slower
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Sandeepti Singh: But also I am recovering from a stomach disease that won’t lemme eat
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm we shall have a dual
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Tara: may the slowest win
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Tara: what should we eat
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah but we cannot do it on purpose
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Bafang lol
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Tara: no we cannot yeah
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Tara: next time we eat bafang
06/05/2022, 14:46 - Tara: we both order how many dumplings?
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Tara: and do you want boba
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Sandeepti Singh: We get the same one and eat 5 dumbpings
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Sandeepti Singh: And time lol
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Tara: ok
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Tara: and we converse
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Then we can do a separate one for boba
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Tara: that's the important part too
06/05/2022, 14:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Yes it should feel normal

07/05/2022, 10:37 - Tara: I thought it was y'all for a second but the imposter didn't have the discharge thing around its eyes
07/05/2022, 10:43 - Sandeepti Singh: we’re working on the discharge thinggggg
07/05/2022, 10:43 - Sandeepti Singh: The place we got it from did a bad job
07/05/2022, 10:56 - Tara: Yeah it's fine bro
07/05/2022, 10:56 - Tara: He's much better from the first pic i saw of him
07/05/2022, 12:08 - Tara: Can't believe we're only 10 years younger than HKUST
07/05/2022, 12:09 - Tara: Sorry I just passed HKU
07/05/2022, 12:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh hahaha
07/05/2022, 13:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 13:19 - Sandeepti Singh: is it different enough?
07/05/2022, 13:51 - Tara: yeah it's good
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Sandeepti Singh: do you still use channel_max and channel_min?
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Tara: you use channel_max = median(median)
i use max(median)
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Tara: and we calculated k differently
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Tara: and we initialised the arrays differently
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Tara: anyway it's good
07/05/2022, 13:52 - Tara: yes
07/05/2022, 13:53 - Sandeepti Singh: do you mind changing that lol. min max something hahah
07/05/2022, 13:53 - Sandeepti Singh: same variable names is not great
07/05/2022, 13:54 - Tara: oui
07/05/2022, 13:54 - Tara: done
07/05/2022, 13:54 - Tara: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 13:55 - Tara: how's the writeup
07/05/2022, 13:56 - Sandeepti Singh: working on it now
07/05/2022, 13:56 - Sandeepti Singh: what did you put for the theorectical analysis and evailuation thing
07/05/2022, 13:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm stumped
07/05/2022, 13:57 - Tara: i did not follow their questions
07/05/2022, 13:57 - Tara: oh
07/05/2022, 13:57 - Tara: equalisation
07/05/2022, 13:57 - Tara: plots - i gave the final plots
07/05/2022, 13:58 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh
07/05/2022, 13:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i should be done with the report in 30 ish minutes
07/05/2022, 13:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i had to go give lunch to my parents
07/05/2022, 13:59 - Sandeepti Singh: so i started studyng later than i wanted to
07/05/2022, 13:59 - Tara: aight
07/05/2022, 13:59 - Tara: tbf i only just started studying
07/05/2022, 14:01 - Sandeepti Singh: eh it's okay it's saturday
07/05/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: hey i know a way to make our code different
07/05/2022, 14:28 - Sandeepti Singh: instead of using median() can you try using mean()
07/05/2022, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: the values should be about the same
07/05/2022, 14:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i think mean might work better for you since your channel is not that noisy
07/05/2022, 14:29 - Tara: o lemme try
07/05/2022, 14:30 - Tara: oh yikes
07/05/2022, 14:30 - Tara: it increases it
07/05/2022, 14:30 - Sandeepti Singh: huh really?
07/05/2022, 14:30 - Tara: i'll keep it as min and max
07/05/2022, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: okay. for me mean and median give the same values
07/05/2022, 14:31 - Tara: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 14:31 - Tara: not sure why i had to write it
07/05/2022, 14:31 - Tara: but i did
07/05/2022, 14:31 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
07/05/2022, 14:32 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 14:32 - Tara: oh wait ours is different anyway because im using min/max and you're using median
07/05/2022, 14:32 - Tara: ah nice
07/05/2022, 14:33 - Sandeepti Singh: oh so if i swithc to using mean our code will be more different
07/05/2022, 14:33 - Tara: no it wont make a difference
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Tara: you can do it if it's fine
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh your variable name is terrible
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Sandeepti Singh: you're not using median function at all
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Tara: nop
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah then can u change the var name? it'll just make it more obvuous?
07/05/2022, 14:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: obviously u don't have to
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Tara: yeah i did
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh nciee
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Tara: i sent the old one
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: ahhh thanks i like how diff the code is now
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Tara: hahaha
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Tara: peace of mind 😇
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: yeahhhh
07/05/2022, 14:35 - Sandeepti Singh: i am stuck between choosing mean and median cuz i get basically thre same values
07/05/2022, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: actually mean is lower so i'll switch to that
07/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: i think mean makes more sense
07/05/2022, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but mean is more affected by random really big noise
07/05/2022, 14:36 - Sandeepti Singh: so it's a bit more based on luck?
07/05/2022, 14:36 - Tara: how is median determined with only three values ?
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: oh
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: it's the middle
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: median is not determined by three values. i think u don't get what i'm trying to do with the code
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: im sorry i got it confused with mode
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Tara: no i do sorry
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: haha okay
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: good our methods are different enough
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: almost done with report
07/05/2022, 14:37 - Sandeepti Singh: shall send it whenever ur free
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Tara: ok
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Tara: should i send mine to you as well
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Sandeepti Singh: later?
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Sandeepti Singh: so it's not me looking at ur report and influencing my writing
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Tara: oh yeah when you send yours i shall send mine
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Tara: like a pdf
07/05/2022, 14:38 - Sandeepti Singh: okayyy
07/05/2022, 14:39 - Tara: so we just submit it assuming there aren't any major changes
07/05/2022, 14:39 - Tara: to be made
07/05/2022, 14:39 - Sandeepti Singh: sure
07/05/2022, 14:59 - Sandeepti Singh: done with the report
07/05/2022, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 15:00 - Tara: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: ohhh i see what they mean with the two graph things
07/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: damn
07/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: our reports are _very_ different
07/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: lol
07/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah lmao
07/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: you have a lot of information from coruse material whereas i stuck to project details
07/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: idk which one is better
07/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: 🤷‍♀️ as long as it's within the word limit
07/05/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i will include the table with my final energy and BER
07/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: i have just one format i use for reports
07/05/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
07/05/2022, 15:05 - Tara: ok i think
07/05/2022, 15:05 - Tara: both reports cover everything?
07/05/2022, 15:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I think so
07/05/2022, 15:05 - Tara: cool
07/05/2022, 15:05 - Tara: good report 10/10

07/05/2022, 15:07 - Tara: oh god they have a turnitin report
07/05/2022, 15:07 - Tara: i feel like i should source the lecture slides
07/05/2022, 15:11 - Sandeepti Singh: hhahah
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: wow i was worried for nothing
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: 2% similarity
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: 1% from my name
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: lmaooo
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Sandeepti Singh: who has your same name
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: it was definitely from another project
07/05/2022, 15:18 - Tara: which is floating around on the internet
07/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: i expected more
07/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: like do they not upload their lecture slides
07/05/2022, 15:21 - Sandeepti Singh: they do not
07/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: i mean students
07/05/2022, 15:21 - Tara: why are they not uploading them for frikking coursehero credits

07/05/2022, 15:22 - Tara: i know where it's from

07/05/2022, 15:23 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
07/05/2022, 15:28 - Tara: <Media omitted>

07/05/2022, 15:29 - Sandeepti Singh: genuinely
07/05/2022, 15:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't know the breeds of the cats
07/05/2022, 15:29 - Tara: fair enough?? still mildly concerning
07/05/2022, 15:29 - Tara: i know like five (5)
07/05/2022, 15:29 - Tara: and i know about 2 dog breeds because my friends have those
07/05/2022, 15:29 - Tara: aka you and merilyn
07/05/2022, 15:30 - Sandeepti Singh: oh apparently leo's breed is fishy
07/05/2022, 15:30 - Sandeepti Singh: like technically he's a toy poodle
07/05/2022, 15:30 - Tara: ok i know 1.25 dog breeds
07/05/2022, 15:30 - Tara: but?
07/05/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: but he looks more like a mix between toy poodle and a maltese
07/05/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: we thoroughly investigated
07/05/2022, 15:31 - Sandeepti Singh: using google images
07/05/2022, 15:32 - Tara: awww maltese's look so cute
07/05/2022, 15:32 - Tara: fudge me nvm

07/05/2022, 15:33 - Tara: around its eyes
07/05/2022, 15:33 - Sandeepti Singh: apparentlyy the main dfferece is maltese have straighter hair while poodle have culry
07/05/2022, 15:33 - Tara: idk if that's a normal dog thing or a maltese dog thing
07/05/2022, 15:33 - Sandeepti Singh: leo's hair is half straight half curly
07/05/2022, 15:33 - Sandeepti Singh: exacltyyyy

07/05/2022, 15:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it's like so pure love. i do nothing for him except play with hum
07/05/2022, 15:37 - Tara: babies are annoying and useless
07/05/2022, 15:37 - Tara: puppies though

07/05/2022, 15:37 - Tara: *
07/05/2022, 15:37 - Tara: they haven't gotten used to their little feetsies
07/05/2022, 15:37 - Sandeepti Singh: yo i'm discussing 2600 with haruki rn so i'm sorry if my replies are a bit slow
07/05/2022, 15:38 - Tara: it's cool
07/05/2022, 15:38 - Tara: i am gushing over small animals
07/05/2022, 15:38 - Tara: i mean i am working
07/05/2022, 15:38 - Tara: very hard on elec2400
07/05/2022, 15:38 - Tara: no animals allowed
07/05/2022, 16:08 - Sandeepti Singh: how does one recover
07/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: i told haruki e^4/3 * e^8/3 is e^32/9
07/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: i multiplied the exponentials
07/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: and said it so confindentlu
07/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: bye
07/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm like going off the grid

07/05/2022, 16:10 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: hahahhaa
07/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: if it makes you feel better we were coparing homework once and it took an hour for us to figure out that his answer was the same as ours just written differently
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: No it does not
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I am questioning my major
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: And existence
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I forgot exponential
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: lol what would you do instead
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: of stem
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Tara: if you had the option
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Sing
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I am extremely talented
07/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually that’s a lie I’d just be like a lawyer or something
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: both sound funb
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: fun
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Sandeepti Singh: For real if my mum was not a lawyer I would have been a lawyer
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Wbu?
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: hmm a not stem major
07/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: i have not thought about that
07/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: done some googling
07/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: i dislike all of these majors
07/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: i guess the closest thing would be like forensic psychology
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh that is pretty cool
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: but i saw a john oliver video on how that's often innacurate
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: im not like interested in it though
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: it's just the most interesting out of all the majors available
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: i think as long as i make good money i'd do anything
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: hahaha
07/05/2022, 16:25 - Tara: fair
07/05/2022, 16:26 - Sandeepti Singh: my brain hurts lol

09/05/2022, 13:42 - Tara: You know how I said I laugh at inappropriate situations
09/05/2022, 13:43 - Tara: So when Wanda snapped Xavier's neck

09/05/2022, 13:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg ikr
09/05/2022, 13:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Why was it of the horror genre???

09/05/2022, 13:49 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah it was so tropey too
09/05/2022, 13:50 - Tara: The only reason I liked Marvel was because it was more light-hearted than DC

09/05/2022, 13:50 - Tara: I was expecting her to be on Strange's side
09/05/2022, 13:50 - Sandeepti Singh: Me throughout the whole movie “I support women’s rights. But I also supports women’s wrongs (if it’s Wanda)”

11/05/2022, 00:53 - Tara: awww
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Sandeepti Singh: and i don't remember all of it but i was terrible
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Sandeepti Singh: like she thought i wanted to break up
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Tara: wait i thought you were ?
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Tara: or did you get back together
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i was just saying everything about the relationship that made me sad??? and half of it had never even come to mind
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Tara: or was this pre hsv
11/05/2022, 00:53 - Sandeepti Singh: oH MY GOD did i not tell u
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: i got back together with her like 2 days later
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: i think not telling me was terrible and like the other stuff
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Tara: hai ram
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: but she is trying
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Tara: yes she's good in that way
11/05/2022, 00:54 - Sandeepti Singh: like she cancelled on staycation with winnie so she can stay with me
11/05/2022, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: and just in general i think she's trying. like now she texts me every few hours to update me when she will get home if plans change
11/05/2022, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: so i think it's oaky
11/05/2022, 00:55 - Tara: great glad to hear
11/05/2022, 00:55 - Sandeepti Singh: i was just sadder when i broke up so i think it's better to just be together lo
11/05/2022, 00:55 - Tara: if everyone's happy i'm happy
11/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: hmmmm not exactly the healthiest attitude but she's a good person so
11/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: actually
11/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: idk
11/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: anyway if you guys are good
11/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i think so
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: lol sorry i unloaded u that day
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: what day
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: hsv?
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: but hsv thing is like 90% of people under 50 have it in the us????
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: so i think i overreacted
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: a bit but again you didn't know the full story
11/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: and like she understands the thing about not telling me and was apologetic
11/05/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah agreed. i legit told her that i'm willing to forgive this time but like i'm not forgetting that she did massively break my trust
11/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: also i will always have amazing advice but i draw the line at free therapy tyvm ik you dont but after siddarth god no
11/05/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: and that if something like this happens again then i wouldn't be as understanding an well probably end it
11/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: good thinking
11/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: second chances are good
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: for real tell me anytime if i'm unloading too much
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i won't be mad/offended
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: yeet and vice versa
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think the hsv day i was really anxious and i jsut needed someone to talk to about it a bit
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Sandeepti Singh: so i could share my thoughts u know
11/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: i understand dw
11/05/2022, 01:01 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks so much bestie #1

11/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: you can bs well
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Sandeepti Singh: SARTHAK ASKED ME TO NOMINATE HIM
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Sandeepti Singh: And i agreed
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: no
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Then I realised I was on waitlist
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Tara: ma'am you should hav ebeen like oh nominate me and i'll do the same
11/05/2022, 16:12 - Sandeepti Singh: And I’m like ?????? I need to nominate myself but I haven’t told him
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: tell him 
get those nominations
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: gather all the friends
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Sandeepti Singh: He already nomintated himself
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: this is a serious matter
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh Vinayak and Hansika are in it too
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: and vignesh?
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Ma’am should I genuinely email them
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yea he might be too
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: absolutely
11/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: i will threaten them if they do not
11/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: actually vinayak probably nominated sarthak already
11/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: because of the roommates thing
11/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: yeahh
11/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme get to hansika first
11/05/2022, 16:15 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah it's a race now
11/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: sis i was going over 2350 homework and spent half an hour trying to figure out this one small part
11/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: because they didnt teach us how to do it in class
11/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: useless course
11/05/2022, 16:40 - Sandeepti Singh: What’s the point of hw that u didn’t teach
11/05/2022, 16:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Like the whole point is to practice what they taught
11/05/2022, 16:40 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 16:40 - Sandeepti Singh: No cry
11/05/2022, 16:40 - Sandeepti Singh: We only slayyy

11/05/2022, 16:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh never done reaction with my phone before
11/05/2022, 16:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Funky
11/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: https://youtu.be/ZkzNAhppysE?t=56
11/05/2022, 16:43 - Tara: """big slay"""
11/05/2022, 16:44 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA
11/05/2022, 16:44 - Sandeepti Singh: BIG SLAY
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: imma be saying that very very frequently now
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: be prepared
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: you were warned
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: big slay
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
11/05/2022, 16:45 - Tara: oh no
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: my god i'm actually laughing
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: do you still hiss at people
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: only at you
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: i need to randomly stop flirting with you
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: unnerving
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: it's cool this is scary enough
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Tara: to offset whatever's happening
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
11/05/2022, 16:46 - Sandeepti Singh: rude
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: but justified
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: omg
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: it's a toned down version of an anti horny spray
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: :)
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: omg yes it is
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: next time a guy hits on me
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Sandeepti Singh: i send this
11/05/2022, 16:47 - Tara: yep
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Sandeepti Singh: lmaooo
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: every time i look at it
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: the teeth
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: are just
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Tara: like no
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Sandeepti Singh: no i completely agree lmao
11/05/2022, 16:48 - Sandeepti Singh: its's just
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: chilling
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: whenever i look at it i think of closeup
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: omg YES
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: YES
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Sandeepti Singh: now i can't unremember that
11/05/2022, 16:49 - Tara: you're welcome
11/05/2022, 16:50 - Tara: ok i need to figure out how i did another question bye
11/05/2022, 16:50 - Sandeepti Singh: bye ❤️
11/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: ❤️
11/05/2022, 17:54 - Sandeepti Singh: do you think they're gonna stop recordings
11/05/2022, 17:55 - Tara: next sem?
11/05/2022, 17:55 - Tara: oh boy maybe
11/05/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: oh no
11/05/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: i will legit perish if they do that
11/05/2022, 17:56 - Sandeepti Singh: how????
11/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: welp guess we'll just have to buckle up and go to all classes
11/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: especially tutorials
11/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: ok lectures are eh
even if we dont go
not a huge deal
11/05/2022, 17:57 - Sandeepti Singh: fuck me
11/05/2022, 17:57 - Tara: but tutorials
11/05/2022, 17:58 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i legit never go to tutorials
11/05/2022, 20:47 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh why did u need our usernames?
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Tara: i show later
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Tara: it's gonna be amazing
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: okie
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: are you working on your website
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Tara: good thing i have multiple friends
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Tara: or else making user profiles would be a pain
11/05/2022, 20:48 - Sandeepti Singh: oohh i'm excited too now lol
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Tara: i too am excited
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Sandeepti Singh: this may gives us a seratonin high like yesterday's map
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i need it
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yay go work on it bye
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Tara: same bro
11/05/2022, 20:49 - Tara: ok bye
11/05/2022, 20:56 - Sandeepti Singh: oh my is she responding to that question about when exams end now
11/05/2022, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: oop that sounded very judgy
11/05/2022, 20:58 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
11/05/2022, 20:59 - Tara: me?
11/05/2022, 20:59 - Tara: oh no
11/05/2022, 20:59 - Sandeepti Singh: no me sounded judgy
11/05/2022, 20:59 - Sandeepti Singh: lol
11/05/2022, 20:59 - Tara: oh
11/05/2022, 21:00 - Tara: i mean her timing is strange enough that that is a valid question
11/05/2022, 22:03 - Tara: helloooo
11/05/2022, 22:03 - Tara: i show you
11/05/2022, 22:04 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 22:04 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 22:06 - Sandeepti Singh: damnnn wow that looks so good
11/05/2022, 22:07 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm not even gonna take offense to the fact that my post has a later time than some other people
11/05/2022, 22:07 - Tara: :dab:
11/05/2022, 22:07 - Tara: think of it in this way
11/05/2022, 22:07 - Tara: you were added second
11/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: after me ✨
11/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: wait
11/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: yours is one of the earliest
11/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: like second earliest
11/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: ma'am
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: but efje's is beofre mine
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: you're welcome
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: no hers is later
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: like a day later
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: gosh so dramatic
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhhhh
11/05/2022, 22:09 - Sandeepti Singh: wow
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: haha sorry that's the first thing i notied???
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: but no lemme be honest that is so cool
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Tara: i copied a template
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i genuinely feel my seratoning going up
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Tara: all of this is me copying stuff and putting it together
11/05/2022, 22:10 - Sandeepti Singh: shhh don't need to tell me behind the scenes
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme marvel at your beauty
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Tara: ok
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Tara: i made it in two hours from scratch
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Sandeepti Singh: you're websites*
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Sandeepti Singh: wow omg coding god
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Tara: why thank you
11/05/2022, 22:11 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm i'm lowkey excited for making a website later on and showing it to u
11/05/2022, 22:12 - Sandeepti Singh: also, even if you are looking at templates, you're getting the initial ideas by yourself and have the skills to follow the template
11/05/2022, 22:20 - Tara: ok fair fair
11/05/2022, 22:20 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh for the 1200 project we could have calculated how many 0s and 1s we have and do the ratio of the threshold based on that
11/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno why that randomly came to my mind. too late to try and all but randomly thought of it ahah
11/05/2022, 23:30 - Tara: wdym?
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Tara: in the training sequence it was like 500 0's 500 1's 500 0's
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: oh like instead of 0.5min + 0.5 max
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Tara: ohhh
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Tara: i see like in that god awful triangle question
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: so more likely to have BER for when bit is 0
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: so if it's like 0.45min + 0.55 max it may have reduced BER
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm just guessing
11/05/2022, 23:31 - Sandeepti Singh: dunno if it
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: 's right
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: could be wrong lol
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Tara: wanna try it out
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Tara: i feel like that's what that one dude was talking about
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Tara: with the ber graph
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: sure do u wanna try since you have matlab
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Tara: sure
11/05/2022, 23:32 - Sandeepti Singh: like it's too late to actually do it
11/05/2022, 23:33 - Sandeepti Singh: but i'm curious lol
11/05/2022, 23:36 - Tara: im getting a slightly bigger BER
11/05/2022, 23:36 - Tara: :(
11/05/2022, 23:36 - Tara: but
11/05/2022, 23:37 - Tara: i think you can still talk about it
11/05/2022, 23:37 - Tara: i mean you could have
11/05/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh. i'm sure there's an actual way to determing the ratio to get optimla threshold
11/05/2022, 23:37 - Sandeepti Singh: i just don't know it
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Tara: it should be 2/3 1/3
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think it;s something that could have worked after like a bunch of research lol
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but maybe that's not optimal
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Tara: oh no this is only for training
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh BER would be calculated for the actual message
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: not BER
11/05/2022, 23:38 - Sandeepti Singh: i think we actually have to count the number of ones and zeros
11/05/2022, 23:39 - Tara: hmm another thing
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Tara: because a lot of data points don't hit 0
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Tara: we need to calculate another threshold
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Tara: so in total like three threshold equations?
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i calculated min and max
11/05/2022, 23:40 - Tara: one threshold to see what we consider to be 1s and 0s to determine the next threshold
11/05/2022, 23:41 - Sandeepti Singh: i didn't use 0 as my min
11/05/2022, 23:41 - Sandeepti Singh: so i think it was fine
11/05/2022, 23:41 - Tara: i mean like to calculate the number of 1s and 0s we need a threshold
11/05/2022, 23:41 - Tara: would that just be the average
11/05/2022, 23:42 - Tara: and then we calculate the optimal ratio from this for another threshold
11/05/2022, 23:42 - Tara: oh
11/05/2022, 23:42 - Tara: just two then
11/05/2022, 23:42 - Sandeepti Singh: hm? i do not understnad
11/05/2022, 23:43 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 23:43 - Tara: or the second
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: the second
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: i think
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: ah i see
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: not sure
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: if it's the first
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: then we need another threshold equation before it
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: so we can calculate the percentage of transmitted 0s and 1s
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: so in total that's three 😭
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: threshold equations
11/05/2022, 23:44 - Tara: idk what my point is
11/05/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: i have also lost it hhaa
11/05/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe you need sleep
11/05/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe i need sleep
11/05/2022, 23:45 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm planning on waking up early to go to campus tmr
11/05/2022, 23:45 - Tara: good idea let's sleep

11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: you know today i saw i was 2 minutes ahead of you
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: which forced me to work
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: because i was not giving up that lead

11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: ok i stop distracting you bye
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: bye
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: talk to u tmr
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Sandeepti Singh: muah
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: oui oui
11/05/2022, 23:48 - Tara: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 23:49 - Tara: mwah
12/05/2022, 13:07 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
12/05/2022, 13:07 - Sandeepti Singh: shouldn't the boundaries be 0 y and 0 1
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhhh wait no
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm dumb
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Tara: so it's right
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Tara: how come
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Tara: ?
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Sandeepti Singh: actually no i don't agree
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Sandeepti Singh: but i am confused
12/05/2022, 13:08 - Sandeepti Singh: like if 0<x<1 why is y between 0 and 1
12/05/2022, 13:09 - Tara: shouldn't it be 1->infinity
12/05/2022, 13:09 - Tara: or like hmm
12/05/2022, 13:09 - Tara: wouldn't beta be x
12/05/2022, 13:09 - Tara: alpha y
12/05/2022, 13:09 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but the equation is x+ y
12/05/2022, 13:10 - Sandeepti Singh: so when they replaced it with alpha and beta i assumed x = alpha
12/05/2022, 13:10 - Tara: x=beta so that's 0<beta<1
y=alpha so that's 1<alpha<x?
12/05/2022, 13:11 - Tara: no
12/05/2022, 13:11 - Sandeepti Singh: i think they made x = alpha
12/05/2022, 13:11 - Tara: but the limit of x is 0->1 which corresponds to beta
12/05/2022, 13:12 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah absolutely agreed
12/05/2022, 13:12 - Sandeepti Singh: why would they go x y to beta alpha
12/05/2022, 13:12 - Sandeepti Singh: that's just messed up
12/05/2022, 13:12 - Tara: if it's just alpha+beta then the order of integration shouldn't matter right
12/05/2022, 13:12 - Tara: i forgot
12/05/2022, 13:13 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah yeah agreed
12/05/2022, 13:13 - Sandeepti Singh: i thought i had gotten double integration's concept wrong
12/05/2022, 13:13 - Sandeepti Singh: but my boundaries are correct i think they just chose beta for x
12/05/2022, 13:13 - Tara: so why is it 0->x ?
12/05/2022, 13:14 - Sandeepti Singh: no idea
12/05/2022, 13:16 - Sandeepti Singh: like y> 1
12/05/2022, 13:16 - Sandeepti Singh: so there's no way it can be between 0 and 1
12/05/2022, 13:16 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz y can never be 1 anyways
12/05/2022, 13:16 - Sandeepti Singh: 0*
12/05/2022, 13:29 - Sandeepti Singh: lol i still don't understand i'll jsut watch tuttorial video
12/05/2022, 13:56 - Tara: Have you caught up on Derry girls
12/05/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: oh nooo not yet
12/05/2022, 14:50 - Sandeepti Singh: the last one i saw was when they went to get that dead body
12/05/2022, 14:50 - Tara: Get to episode 55555
12/05/2022, 14:51 - Tara: I can't elongate the 5
12/05/2022, 14:51 - Tara: Wait
12/05/2022, 14:51 - Tara: Fiveeeee
12/05/2022, 14:56 - Sandeepti Singh: hahahh okay i shall look at it later
12/05/2022, 15:00 - Sandeepti Singh: question
12/05/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: so for 2600 they said we can use this link for calculator https://www.wolframalpha.com/
12/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: Le gasp
12/05/2022, 15:01 - Sandeepti Singh: but when u click on it there is an integrator calculator
12/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: Amazing
12/05/2022, 15:01 - Tara: Oh
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: Oh I do not see just the integral calc
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: so do you think we can use the integrator calculator
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: Yeah
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: Double integrals are ew
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: calculus
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: and analysis
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: has integration
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: so can i just use that damn?
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Tara: Sure
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: like i'm asking if that's cheating
12/05/2022, 15:02 - Sandeepti Singh: they sent the link
12/05/2022, 15:03 - Sandeepti Singh: but still said to use scientific calc
12/05/2022, 15:03 - Tara: What do you see on your laptop
12/05/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
12/05/2022, 15:04 - Sandeepti Singh: and when you click on more examples it gives the actual calculator
12/05/2022, 15:06 - Tara: If they're giving you like the "main" website then there's no issue I think
12/05/2022, 15:06 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i agree

13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: you wanna see the bullshit i wrote to get nominated for hall?
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Tara: It's confirmed
I simply have the best stuff
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Shore
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: yes even in the case of besties
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Hmmmm
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Tara: Yes
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i already sent it but it has some typos but i just want u to the see the level of bullshittery hahaa
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: it's so long lmaop
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: What are the nominee’s major contributions to the School? 

Through the peer mentorship programme, I had the opportunity to connect with year 1 students and guide them through any hardships they faced as new students in this university. I attempted to arrange in person meeting for my mentees whenever it was possible and safe since I felt it was easier to have a conversation with mentees in person allowing for a more personal and engaging conversation with the mentees, me to assess the specific struggles that they were more comfortable sharing in person. Mentees on zoom often had their cameras off, making it difficult to initiate a more impact and personalised conversation. I also believe that peer mentoring is not a temporary responsibility and made my number available to mentees that required frequency help and have even formed a friendship with a few of them. 

For Student Ambassador, I promoted HKUST in you high school, sharing my personal account of the opportunities and valuable experiences I have garnered in this university. For Engineering Student Ambassador, I have participated in the activities hosted for social media promotion to generate publicity for SENG. 

- How would the hall offer, if any, facilitate nominee’s service to the School?

Most of my activities and contributions to HKUST are related to giving insight based on my personal experiences. One of the biggest source of concern for mentees is to do with campus accommodation, especially international students who are drawn to me as a mentor due to similar high school experiences. Incoming students who are considering HKUST as an option share this concern and frequently inquire about hall life as it is an essential part of University life for most. However, my ability to help these students is severely limited by my lack of experiences. Due to never living on campus for a long period of time, I find myself unequipped to thoroughly address these concerns. I believe if I get a hall offer, I will be able to gain insightful experience that can in turn help mentees and potential incoming students. 

Also, the commute to and from HKUST has made it difficult to take part in a lot of on-campus activities, preventing me from interacting with more diverse people and fully immersing myself in university life. Being on campus will allow me to learn about and commit myself to new projects and organisations where I can make an impact.
13/05/2022, 23:29 - Sandeepti Singh: but the bullshit

15/05/2022, 10:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh on the edge of my seat
15/05/2022, 10:27 - Tara: Ah I don't remember the full details and it's a tiny bit sad so idk prepare yourself?
15/05/2022, 10:31 - Tara: Ok so I was at WIS and I had to set up a birthday party with someone (might have been my year 8 friend Alice) after maths class so we pulled the curtains down set up the tables etc
Then I went down to the management office to work there? And I entrusted a cup of valuable coins to someone
Then idk how but Alice and I were no longer friends? But I had the feeling that either she was a dick or I did something
I then went to get the coins from the dude but he wasn't giving it so I had to trick him and during that time my year 1/6 teacher from Kennedy came in and glared at me because apparently that was Wrong
Which sucked because she was my fav teacher
Anyway I took the bus to the graveyard next to the school and met up with Fleabag's dad / my grandfather to mourn someone?
15/05/2022, 10:31 - Tara: I blame Fleabag and Siddarth for all this
15/05/2022, 12:04 - Tara: Bro sign up for TOEFL

15/05/2022, 16:07 - Sandeepti Singh: but lemme check my notes
15/05/2022, 16:07 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe they explain bette
15/05/2022, 16:07 - Tara: Thank you
15/05/2022, 16:08 - Sandeepti Singh: lol the thankl you was premature
15/05/2022, 16:08 - Sandeepti Singh: my ntoes for that part are LOL
15/05/2022, 16:08 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme send
15/05/2022, 16:09 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 16:10 - Sandeepti Singh: the part 4 is just terrible
15/05/2022, 16:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i may have given up cuz i didn't understand it
15/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: I think hmm
pe1 = 1-Q([T-rmax]/sigma)
so they use T-rmax as the upper limit -0.5 as the lower limit?
15/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 16:17 - Tara: if they asked us to find rmin i think it would be
upper limit = 0.5
lower limit = T-rmin
integral from ^^^ = 0.02
15/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: kill me now this equation is infinitely worse than part 3
15/05/2022, 16:22 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: okay got it
15/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: im just gonna use symbolab ffs
15/05/2022, 16:23 - Tara: this is annoying
15/05/2022, 16:26 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 16:27 - Tara: oh RIP in elec1200 to calculate SNR they use 10
in elec2400 they use 20
15/05/2022, 16:27 - Tara: that's not confusing
15/05/2022, 18:34 - Tara: hello again i have a question about homework 1 q4b
how did we calculate bit time
it's 3us
is it 1us * SPB(=3)?
15/05/2022, 18:38 - Tara: sorry but today is 1200 homework/tutorial day so i will have questions hope ydm
15/05/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: lemme double check i do not rememebr
15/05/2022, 18:55 - Sandeepti Singh: bit time is just spb/fs
15/05/2022, 18:55 - Sandeepti Singh: what values did we have for hw 1
15/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: ohh
15/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: 10MHz, SPB=3
15/05/2022, 19:03 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah so just 3/10^6 i think
15/05/2022, 19:03 - Tara: You deleted this message
15/05/2022, 19:03 - Tara: You deleted this message
15/05/2022, 19:03 - Tara: You deleted this message
15/05/2022, 19:03 - Tara: ok _so_
yes
agreed
15/05/2022, 19:04 - Tara: dfkjhshj i was looking at q1
15/05/2022, 19:11 - Sandeepti Singh: hahah
15/05/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: hey do you have time for a 2600 questions
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Tara: yes
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm having trouble with the bounds of the double integral
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Tara: idk why but this is one of the days where i would rather perish than do my own work 
too antsy smh
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: my doubt in part d
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: hahaha
15/05/2022, 19:16 - Sandeepti Singh: i have done so little today
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: may just study till like 3
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Tara: but you woke up early :(
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: exactly : (
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Tara: oh ewwww
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: this question will probably def come
15/05/2022, 19:17 - Sandeepti Singh: but i do NOT understand the bounds
15/05/2022, 19:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i tried drawing it out too cuz our homework had a similar question but only pdf so they drew it out but it's still too difficult
15/05/2022, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: is vinayak in hk
15/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: what year is this paper
15/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: idk
15/05/2022, 19:21 - Sandeepti Singh: 2019 i think
15/05/2022, 19:22 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:22 - Tara: I will
15/05/2022, 19:22 - Tara: Decipher it somehow
15/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao
15/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: dammit we had the same approach
15/05/2022, 19:25 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but why are my integrals fucked
15/05/2022, 19:26 - Sandeepti Singh: like for between 8 to 9
15/05/2022, 19:26 - Sandeepti Singh: i thought the bottom would be like z - 6 and the top would be like z - 2 for dy
15/05/2022, 19:26 - Sandeepti Singh: but then they're both normal numbers??
15/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: like i tried this so many times but i keep messing up the integrals
15/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: rn my method is just copy this general approach if the question comes up lmao
15/05/2022, 19:28 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks though
15/05/2022, 19:35 - Tara: hhhhh im sorry idk bro
15/05/2022, 19:35 - Tara: i got this?
15/05/2022, 19:35 - Tara: but it's not completely done
15/05/2022, 19:36 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 19:36 - Tara: i dunno
15/05/2022, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: oooh thanks a lot
15/05/2022, 19:58 - Sandeepti Singh: ugh whatsapp not giving notifs again
15/05/2022, 19:59 - Tara: I hope it gives more of an idea of the bound?? I still dunno how or why they're doing z-x
15/05/2022, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah same. i'm not a 100 percent sure about the bounds
15/05/2022, 19:59 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think if the question comes up i know in general how to replicate it give it is open book
15/05/2022, 19:59 - Tara: Yep
15/05/2022, 20:00 - Tara: Maybe they're also using a product? Like where is 6 coming from
15/05/2022, 20:01 - Sandeepti Singh: that i get. for it to be 8 it's 6+2 right
15/05/2022, 20:01 - Sandeepti Singh: so the bound is 6 cuz x will be 6 max
15/05/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: but i don't get is why the lower bound is 2?? i have a little given up on understanding the bounds for that
15/05/2022, 20:02 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe i'll ask haruki
15/05/2022, 20:02 - Tara: Oh the lower bounds is just (2,2)
15/05/2022, 20:03 - Tara: Vexause
15/05/2022, 20:03 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but i don't agree with it for when z is between 8 and 9?
15/05/2022, 20:04 - Tara: In each limit here like 4<z<8
The smallest product is 2*2
15/05/2022, 20:04 - Tara: Wait lol how about 9<z<13
15/05/2022, 20:04 - Tara: The smallest product is 3*3
15/05/2022, 20:04 - Tara: 2*4
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Tara: But you also have 2*5?
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: why are they multipying
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Tara: Yeah
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: i thought it would only be addition?
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Tara: Because f(z)=f(x)*f(y)
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Tara: Oh
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Tara: No
15/05/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: z = y + x
15/05/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: so why *
15/05/2022, 20:06 - Sandeepti Singh: :;(
15/05/2022, 20:07 - Tara: _oh_ that explains stuff
15/05/2022, 20:07 - Tara: Hmm
15/05/2022, 20:07 - Tara: I'm going to eat dinner and go for a walk and I will think about it then
15/05/2022, 20:07 - Tara: I'm hoping for an epiphany
15/05/2022, 20:07 - Tara: Because then why did they have the square
15/05/2022, 20:08 - Tara: Square implies multiplication
15/05/2022, 20:08 - Tara: No that's wrong
15/05/2022, 20:08 - Tara: Lol
15/05/2022, 20:09 - Tara: I'm forecasting an epic headache soon so sorry if I cannot figure it out
15/05/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: the square is jsut the upper and lower bounds for x and y
15/05/2022, 20:09 - Tara: Ugh so annoying
15/05/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: pls do lol i'm just skipping it for now
15/05/2022, 20:09 - Sandeepti Singh: spent way too long on it
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Tara: I need to write everything down again 
Later though
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Tara: I will not sleep until one of us figures it out
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah no rush
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Tara: Unless it's 3am
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Tara: I will not sleep before 1am until one of us figures it out
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: hahahaha thanks ❤️
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll move on
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Tara: Ok
15/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: but quick question
15/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: your final exam
15/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: was it just ur tutorials and hw but with differnet numbers ish
15/05/2022, 20:11 - Tara: Yes
15/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: or were there random extra questions
15/05/2022, 20:12 - Tara: No
15/05/2022, 20:12 - Tara: Oh
15/05/2022, 20:12 - Tara: Actually
15/05/2022, 20:12 - Tara: Maybe because I took H but we had 2? Extra questions
15/05/2022, 20:13 - Tara: Completely different from the homework
15/05/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: oh damnnn
15/05/2022, 20:13 - Sandeepti Singh: okie enjoy ur walk
15/05/2022, 20:13 - Tara: Thanks
15/05/2022, 20:14 - Tara: Enjoy the rest of the questions
15/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: Is the lower bound 2 because for each limit
4-8: 2+2
8-9: 2+6
9-13: 2+7
15/05/2022, 21:09 - Tara: So that's x I think
15/05/2022, 21:09 - Tara: You deleted this message
15/05/2022, 21:09 - Tara: You deleted this message
15/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: I'm writing this while walking 
I'm gonna die probably
15/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Risking my life for maths /s
15/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: Don't you dare put that on my imaginary headstone
15/05/2022, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Nooo omg don’t
15/05/2022, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahhaa
15/05/2022, 21:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh okay that would make sense
15/05/2022, 21:18 - Tara: Nope I can't type stuff I need to write it down
15/05/2022, 21:18 - Tara: For now I will simply stare at the question
15/05/2022, 21:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
15/05/2022, 21:28 - Tara: Dammit I just had something then I deleted it because I was looking at the wrong thing
15/05/2022, 21:28 - Tara: Anyway lemme retype
15/05/2022, 21:35 - Tara: 4-8
4-z-8
4<x+y<8
4-x < y < 8-x
We've got
Lower bound: 2+2
Upper bound: 2+6
Sub that in
4-2 < y < 8-6
y=2
x+y=z
x=z-y= z-2?
15/05/2022, 21:36 - Tara: Wow that's just the upper bound of x
I'm gonna cry
15/05/2022, 21:39 - Tara: I guess the y bounds are easier?
Again the min is 2
Max: x+y=z -> y=z-x
15/05/2022, 21:39 - Tara: For the next thing I think it's because the upper bound involves 7 from y then it's 2-6
15/05/2022, 21:40 - Tara: And the y thing is the same because you can also have 2(y)+6(X)
15/05/2022, 21:41 - Tara: So the lower bound is 2
Upper is z-x
15/05/2022, 21:42 - Tara: The max is that I think because y doesn't go up to 7
15/05/2022, 21:44 - Tara: I'm sorry this answer is such a mess
15/05/2022, 22:02 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 22:08 - Tara: It's very sad how 50% of our gallery in this chat is maths
The rest is utter garbage
15/05/2022, 22:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh I think I kinda get it
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll try it again
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: I was having dinner lol
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: And booked by toefl
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Tara: bless because idk what's going on
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: 2K hkd cri
15/05/2022, 22:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Haruki explained it to matter of fact
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Also what I think about when I do bounds is
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: “Does x or y move when z changes?”
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Move as in does the bound change
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Like great that he’s helpful
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Tara: ehm
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Sandeepti Singh: But he’s too smart lol
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Tara: ok
15/05/2022, 22:20 - Tara: how does that translate to le maths
15/05/2022, 22:21 - Tara: yesh agreed
15/05/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll try it again in a bit
15/05/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Omg yes sad
15/05/2022, 22:21 - Tara: y is constant at 2 in the first part right (hopefully)
15/05/2022, 22:21 - Sandeepti Singh: We’re only gonna send each other memes over the summer lol
15/05/2022, 22:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually I get it for some of them I don’t get it for all
15/05/2022, 22:22 - Sandeepti Singh: I do that thing where I draw lines parallel to the axis to see what the bound is
15/05/2022, 22:22 - Tara: mhm until we start the online courses
15/05/2022, 22:22 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh lmao
15/05/2022, 22:22 - Tara: then it's gonna be 
oh how did you do the k means clustering etc etc
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: this project has too many dependencies let's push it to main
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: (idk)
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: nerds ✨
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: oh did you do the github thing
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: that one time you asked about your portfolio
15/05/2022, 22:23 - Tara: did you figure it out
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Sandeepti Singh: A bit
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Sandeepti Singh: I just barely have anything to put on there w
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Sandeepti Singh: Gonna need to work on having more projects
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Tara: yes
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Tara: we do machine learning
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Tara: we will be experts
15/05/2022, 22:24 - Tara: mwahaha
15/05/2022, 22:26 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA yess
15/05/2022, 22:27 - Tara: crying throwing up etc why does last semester's homework 1 have _nine_ questions
15/05/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: For 1200
15/05/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
15/05/2022, 22:33 - Sandeepti Singh: Damn
15/05/2022, 22:33 - Tara: yes
15/05/2022, 22:34 - Tara: :)
15/05/2022, 22:34 - Sandeepti Singh: My god
15/05/2022, 22:34 - Sandeepti Singh: I have 7 days to prepare for the final lol
15/05/2022, 22:38 - Tara: oh fudge
15/05/2022, 22:38 - Tara: i feel wholly underprepared
15/05/2022, 22:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Ma’am
15/05/2022, 22:40 - Sandeepti Singh: I have not prepared anything for it yet
15/05/2022, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ll legit start after 2600
15/05/2022, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: So I think in comparison ur fine
15/05/2022, 22:41 - Tara: aaaaaaaaaaaa
15/05/2022, 22:41 - Tara: <Media omitted>
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: I am 0% stressed though
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Tara: oh god how
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I kept reviewing it for lab quizzes anyways
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Tara: i need that
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: I have 7 days before the final
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Like a week Is a long time
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: I have no other exams in between
15/05/2022, 22:47 - Sandeepti Singh: 7 days to review one course is sufficient I think
15/05/2022, 22:48 - Tara: yes
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: My brain is completely fried
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: I'm going to sleep
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Same
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Goodnight
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Today was terribly unproductive for me
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I will make up for it tmr
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Gn
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: I'm gonna have a headache tomorrow I just know it
Great timing
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: Bai
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Byeee
15/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Gn
16/05/2022, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: oh slayyy
16/05/2022, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: teach me after tmr pls
16/05/2022, 12:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i still do not stan that question
16/05/2022, 12:31 - Tara: yesh
16/05/2022, 12:31 - Tara: it slayed me
16/05/2022, 12:33 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA i love that
16/05/2022, 12:33 - Sandeepti Singh: imma copy "it slayed me"
16/05/2022, 12:34 - Tara: <Media omitted>

16/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh. They’ll deduct 1 mark for that I think
16/05/2022, 14:18 - Sandeepti Singh: It’s a minor mistake
16/05/2022, 14:19 - Tara: indeed
16/05/2022, 14:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Weird though

19/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: Getting headphones
19/05/2022, 00:06 - Tara: <Media omitted>
19/05/2022, 00:42 - Tara: Oh bro I completely forgot to tell you what I concluded after thinking that I was incapable of love
19/05/2022, 00:42 - Tara: I do love people
19/05/2022, 00:42 - Tara: I love you guys and the WIS folks because in the end they bring me happiness and have not caused me any pain
19/05/2022, 00:43 - Tara: Talking to people is hard but in the end you're right it's worth it
19/05/2022, 00:44 - Tara: E.g. did I tell you that I cut off the WIS people for a bit because they were dismissive of the Trauma
Well I missed them a lot
Came back
Apologised for overreacting
Told them my pov
And they're great now
19/05/2022, 00:44 - Tara: Thank you for this realisation ❤️❤️
19/05/2022, 00:45 - Tara: A week*
19/05/2022, 00:45 - Tara: I overreact sometimes
That's another thing I dislike about myself
But now I'm like thinking a lot about the consequences of my actions
19/05/2022, 00:46 - Tara: Ok bye
19/05/2022, 00:46 - Tara: <Media omitted>
19/05/2022, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Ahhh sorry I didn’t see this I was in my brother’s room
19/05/2022, 01:08 - Sandeepti Singh: I feel like even if it is a slight overreaction I would maintain that ur feelings are still valid
19/05/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: If u felt strongly about it it’s just ur reaction
19/05/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: But also when u told them about it they understood right
19/05/2022, 01:09 - Sandeepti Singh: I also feel like o over react about stuff with efje but u know what if I feel so strongly about it then it’s clearly stuff that’s important to me and I shouldn’t dismiss how I feel about it
19/05/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: And it think that goes for u too
19/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: Indeed
19/05/2022, 01:10 - Tara: They were nice about it
Apologised
Definitely started being more compassionate and stuff
19/05/2022, 01:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Seeee don’t cut them off. Be honest from the start
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: People who learn from their actions 💯💯
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Agreed
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: Yes I need to stop doing that
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: If they care about u they change
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: I think if u tell someone and they refuse to change then cutting off might be an option
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Sandeepti Singh: But still first try to make the other person understand?
19/05/2022, 01:11 - Tara: Sienna though I told her and she didn't do anything so she's gone
19/05/2022, 01:12 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I agree with the cutting offer
19/05/2022, 01:12 - Tara: Vindication
19/05/2022, 01:12 - Tara: Anyway thank you

21/05/2022, 22:39 - Tara: cool
21/05/2022, 22:57 - Tara: new past-time: reading about old american presidents 
so much tea
they're also all very unattractive idk why anyone voted for them
21/05/2022, 22:57 - Tara: You deleted this message
21/05/2022, 22:58 - Tara: ...i probably shouldnt vote for people
21/05/2022, 22:59 - Tara: i guess it's relative
21/05/2022, 23:00 - Tara: i think im mildly tired and should probably not be saying this
21/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: do you know who/what the freemasons are
21/05/2022, 23:02 - Tara: the wikipedia has a lot of words
which doesnt explain anything
21/05/2022, 23:03 - Tara: are their members even in masonry
21/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: ugh stupid secret societies
legitimately what is the point of them
21/05/2022, 23:05 - Tara: they're a brotherhood

21/05/2022, 23:08 - Tara: are they the illuminati
21/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: ok im very sorry for the spam
21/05/2022, 23:09 - Tara: but i have so many questions
22/05/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA no I always enjoy ur spams
22/05/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: I feel like attractiveness = charisma = more liked presidents?
22/05/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Like that would be my guess
22/05/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Lol
22/05/2022, 00:01 - Sandeepti Singh: Nooooo who dat?
22/05/2022, 00:02 - Tara: i have come to the conclusion that they're a cult
22/05/2022, 00:02 - Tara: https://www.history.com/news/freemason-secrets-revealed
22/05/2022, 00:02 - Tara: started off as a stonemason's guild
22/05/2022, 00:03 - Tara: evolved into basically a cult
22/05/2022, 00:03 - Tara: for white men mostly
22/05/2022, 00:03 - Tara: catholics aren't allowed to join
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Ooh yaaas hate cults but catholics have too many privelages
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Sandeepti Singh: Lmao don’t tell anyone I said that
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: direct contact to jesus is a plus i agree
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: wait
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: the bad way
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: yes
22/05/2022, 00:04 - Tara: the only plus?
22/05/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm I am undecided on whether it’s a plus or a negative
22/05/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m so tired omg
22/05/2022, 00:05 - Sandeepti Singh: I was so unproductive today lol

22/05/2022, 00:07 - Tara: ~also me~
22/05/2022, 00:07 - Tara: i think being on people's close friends list is enough for me
22/05/2022, 00:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh true
22/05/2022, 00:10 - Sandeepti Singh: I keep meaning to make a close friends list

22/05/2022, 00:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Review them
22/05/2022, 00:11 - Tara: i have one
but i want to shake it up
22/05/2022, 00:12 - Tara: because i've added people who've added me to their close friends list even though idk why
22/05/2022, 00:12 - Tara: why am i on my second cousin's close friends list
i haven't seen her in years
22/05/2022, 00:12 - Tara: tea though because sibling isn't on hers

22/05/2022, 00:14 - Sandeepti Singh: No clue
22/05/2022, 00:14 - Tara: idk it's very strange because they're the same age
22/05/2022, 00:14 - Tara: like sibling has gone for a sleepover at her house before
22/05/2022, 00:15 - Tara: i had two sets of second cousins in shimla

22/05/2022, 12:24 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 12:26 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 12:43 - Tara: Probably a typo
22/05/2022, 12:43 - Tara: Lemme get to my iPad in a few minutes
22/05/2022, 12:44 - Sandeepti Singh: okay it's in both the suggested answers
22/05/2022, 12:44 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah no rush take your time
22/05/2022, 12:44 - Sandeepti Singh: i jsut sent the question before i forget
22/05/2022, 12:44 - Sandeepti Singh: ooh lemme do urs
22/05/2022, 12:50 - Tara: my god i wrote down ??? for that question but i know how to do it now
22/05/2022, 12:51 - Tara: So you have A0 + A5 + A8 right in part a
22/05/2022, 12:52 - Tara: k = 0, S(0) = 0.5, A0 = 2, S(0)*A0 = 1
k = 5, S(5) = 0.5, A5 = 1, S(5)*A5 = 0.5
k = 8, S(8) = 0, A8 = 2, S(8)*A8 = 0
22/05/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: oh A0 is just 2? we need to take into account it's frequency as well?
22/05/2022, 13:00 - Tara: frequency is 0
22/05/2022, 13:00 - Tara: yeah
22/05/2022, 13:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh
22/05/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh i see
22/05/2022, 13:01 - Sandeepti Singh: so u multiply the value of the Sf with the amplitudes of the different frequencies
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Tara: 🤦‍♀️ i sent abhijith stuff for our elec3120 project like two weeks ago and he still hasn't done the project which is due today my god
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Tara: it's independent but i thought i would help
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Tara: yes
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Sandeepti Singh: will he just use your project???
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Sandeepti Singh: what if he copies?
22/05/2022, 13:02 - Tara: no we have to send an email to the professor
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Tara: encrypting it and stuff
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Tara: he can't use mine
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: okay
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i don't get how people can leave big projects till last minute
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Tara: yeah
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Sandeepti Singh: like i get we have other stuff but i do not understnad
22/05/2022, 13:03 - Tara: i should probably not get irrationally annoyed when people ask stuff at the last minute
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: you can always just ignore
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: except i guess i ask exam review questions last minute
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Tara: yes that's fine
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: but i feel like if i do it too early i'll just forget ahaha
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Tara: you're ok everyone else is annoying
22/05/2022, 13:04 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH

22/05/2022, 13:04 - Tara: i could
22/05/2022, 13:05 - Tara: but then they'll fail
22/05/2022, 13:05 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe ignore based on how much they've helped u?
22/05/2022, 13:05 - Tara: *lose 8% of their grade
22/05/2022, 13:05 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH

22/05/2022, 17:43 - Tara: no im revising 1200 now
22/05/2022, 17:43 - Sandeepti Singh: that also gives me time to go through all questions
22/05/2022, 17:43 - Tara: so im available
22/05/2022, 17:43 - Sandeepti Singh: and then ask u at once
22/05/2022, 17:43 - Tara: oh ok

22/05/2022, 17:44 - Sandeepti Singh: i hate that we're probs gonna have a question on moduclation
22/05/2022, 17:45 - Sandeepti Singh: despite that topic
22/05/2022, 17:45 - Sandeepti Singh: despise
22/05/2022, 17:45 - Tara: it's mean
22/05/2022, 18:17 - Tara: do you understand the forwarding table in dijkstra's algorithm
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Tara: i have _some_ idea but it's not concrete
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh that was my question
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Why is it all z, y
22/05/2022, 18:18 - Sandeepti Singh: I’m so confused
22/05/2022, 18:19 - Tara: i think it's because 
z is the root node
y is the next closest node to the destination and z
22/05/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I get that
22/05/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: But I don’t get why that’s right
22/05/2022, 18:20 - Sandeepti Singh: Why not write z and the node right before
22/05/2022, 18:21 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm they didn’t have forwarding table in the hw
22/05/2022, 18:22 - Tara: oh i think
22/05/2022, 18:22 - Tara: it's because
22/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: it's the "next hop"
22/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: wait no
22/05/2022, 18:23 - Tara: wait yeah
22/05/2022, 18:24 - Tara: More specifically, next hop is an IP address entry in a router's routing table, which specifies the next closest/most optimal router in its routing path
22/05/2022, 18:26 - Tara: should i email cupid
22/05/2022, 18:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh yeah maybe u could?
22/05/2022, 18:27 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz I don’t get the answer
22/05/2022, 18:29 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait we could ask on gc right?
22/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: yeah
on that note
22/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: what is p
22/05/2022, 18:29 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: oh
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: no idea i was just rying to figure that out
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: parity bits
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: okay actually that makes sense
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Tara: just gonna confirm with them
22/05/2022, 18:30 - Sandeepti Singh: would that work when they have an extra parity bit too?
22/05/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: like what if hamming distance is decimal
22/05/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: sometimes they have that diagonal parity buit
22/05/2022, 18:31 - Sandeepti Singh: oh maybe i should just try out with an example
22/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: good point
22/05/2022, 18:31 - Tara: gonnd try too
22/05/2022, 18:32 - Tara: i think they would round up
22/05/2022, 18:32 - Tara: but i don't think it's the best formula to use?
22/05/2022, 18:32 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 18:32 - Sandeepti Singh: so if they have parity bit then that should also chang
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: so d = 4
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Tara: when i have 5 parity bits, d=3
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: 7 parity bits d = 4
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: so 7/2 = 3.5 and u round up
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Tara: oui
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: okay that would make things much quicker
22/05/2022, 18:33 - Sandeepti Singh: but i think i might write it out just in case hahah
22/05/2022, 18:35 - Tara: i can never show my face on the chat again /s
22/05/2022, 18:35 - Tara: kidding im gonna ask about dijkstr'as
22/05/2022, 18:35 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i did not know that the brackets meant rounding uo
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm on question 6
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Sandeepti Singh: wanna jsut do them together after that?
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Sandeepti Singh: or have u allready done the questions once
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Tara: of what paper?
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Sandeepti Singh: oh the final review
22/05/2022, 18:36 - Sandeepti Singh: they had the forwarding table
22/05/2022, 18:37 - Sandeepti Singh: lmao i think i assumed u were doing that
22/05/2022, 18:37 - Tara: in the forwarding table
is the second value the router closest to the source node?
22/05/2022, 18:37 - Tara: is this the question i should ask
22/05/2022, 18:37 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
22/05/2022, 18:37 - Sandeepti Singh: what paper are u doing now?
22/05/2022, 18:38 - Tara: 2019F final
22/05/2022, 18:38 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh okay
22/05/2022, 18:39 - Tara: ive done that question so many times i will cry
22/05/2022, 18:39 - Tara: also please if i ever drink coffee then study kill me
22/05/2022, 18:40 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
22/05/2022, 18:40 - Tara: round up
round down
22/05/2022, 18:40 - Sandeepti Singh: thanksss
22/05/2022, 18:40 - Tara: i only learnt it last year and it was a shock to me
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Tara: ok cool
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Tara: so it's the first step from the source node
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: for the review i don't get q3 B) C)
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah. i think it's just a rule
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: i dunno why i assumed it would be source and then the node right before ti
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: for B is it just the same as period
22/05/2022, 18:41 - Sandeepti Singh: or is that just for this case
22/05/2022, 18:42 - Sandeepti Singh: my other theory for B is you just do it so that the demonimator goes away and u can have 2pi for the numeerator
22/05/2022, 18:43 - Tara: b as in the max question
22/05/2022, 18:43 - Tara: ?
22/05/2022, 18:43 - Tara: i graphed it
22/05/2022, 18:43 - Tara: and then i differentiated because i felt bad
22/05/2022, 18:44 - Sandeepti Singh: oh that's a diffretn quesiton i think?
22/05/2022, 18:44 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wait
22/05/2022, 18:44 - Sandeepti Singh: it's the max question but for the cos stuff
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Sandeepti Singh: just differentiatie /
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Sandeepti Singh: damn
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Sandeepti Singh: i was def overthinking
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Tara: graph it first
22/05/2022, 18:45 - Tara: so much easier
22/05/2022, 18:48 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah okie
22/05/2022, 18:48 - Sandeepti Singh: what about the part afte tthat
22/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: oh ait
22/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: wait
22/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: don't answer
22/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: i know how to do it
22/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: it's the same as the thing before with the frequencey being at 0\
22/05/2022, 18:58 - Tara: ok literally coffee + music + bright lights = bad
do not recommend
22/05/2022, 18:58 - Sandeepti Singh: do u never have coffee otherwise
22/05/2022, 18:58 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
22/05/2022, 18:59 - Tara: i have it sometimes during lunch
22/05/2022, 18:59 - Tara: idk
22/05/2022, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: oh
22/05/2022, 18:59 - Sandeepti Singh: i have coffee now and doesn't it even do anything to me
22/05/2022, 19:00 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
22/05/2022, 19:00 - Tara: coffee literally exacerbates anxiety how are people so used to it
22/05/2022, 19:00 - Sandeepti Singh: that would explain a lot
22/05/2022, 19:07 - Sandeepti Singh: oh haha that was ominous i meant for me lol
22/05/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: i have another question for q6 D
22/05/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: why would it be nothing
22/05/2022, 19:08 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz in the hw question when there was a phase shift they just did it with sin?
22/05/2022, 19:09 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 19:09 - Sandeepti Singh: why does it work in HW then?
22/05/2022, 19:10 - Tara: a 90 degree phase shift turns cosine into sine right
and in the homework they expressed everything as sine
22/05/2022, 19:10 - Tara: oh
22/05/2022, 19:10 - Tara: what
22/05/2022, 19:10 - Tara: i was aruging for the opposite thing
22/05/2022, 19:12 - Tara: oh
22/05/2022, 19:12 - Tara: because
22/05/2022, 19:12 - Tara: so they cancel out when it's cos(f0) and sin(f0)
22/05/2022, 19:12 - Tara: but in question 3
22/05/2022, 19:13 - Tara: they did sin(f0) * cos(fx)
22/05/2022, 19:13 - Tara: 2sin(10kt) * 2cos(7kt)
if it was 2sin(10kt) * 2cos(10kt) then they would cancel out
22/05/2022, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
22/05/2022, 19:13 - Sandeepti Singh: oh that makes sense
22/05/2022, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz they'll combine destructively
22/05/2022, 19:14 - Sandeepti Singh: thanks
22/05/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: i finally understand some parts of demodulation
22/05/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: when they first modulate it use the one with 2 epaks
22/05/2022, 19:15 - Tara: nice
22/05/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: with half the amplitude
22/05/2022, 19:15 - Sandeepti Singh: after demodulation u have the two small peaks in addition to the one big peak
22/05/2022, 19:18 - Tara: oui
22/05/2022, 19:18 - Tara: bro the 2019 paper is hard
22/05/2022, 19:18 - Tara: i cannot
22/05/2022, 19:18 - Sandeepti Singh: do not scare me ma'am
22/05/2022, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: i am still doing review
22/05/2022, 19:19 - Sandeepti Singh: took way longer than i assumed
22/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: oh i think i get like _two_ questions
22/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: but still
22/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: bruh
22/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: bru h
22/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: b r u h
22/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: how is 2400 prep looking though
22/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: oh im on question 3 dw
22/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: it takes a while to decode
22/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: fine will deal with it again after i finish 1200
22/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: ma'am
22/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: that was important onfor
22/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: info
22/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: you know two out of 3 that is not bad
22/05/2022, 19:27 - Tara: yes but i started this an hour ago
22/05/2022, 19:28 - Sandeepti Singh: oh that is bad but also i technically started the final review 3 hours ago
22/05/2022, 19:29 - Tara: Was gonna do two papers today but at this rate I'll only be able to finish one
22/05/2022, 19:29 - Sandeepti Singh: 1 > 0
22/05/2022, 19:29 - Sandeepti Singh: so good job
22/05/2022, 19:30 - Tara: Thank you
22/05/2022, 19:30 - Tara: After finals I'm gonna take a day off social media so I can detox from my fellow classmates
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: day off of me
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i nunderstand
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: but also
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Tara: Hahaha
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Tara: You know I'm probably gonna be really bored and come back to WhatsApp
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Tara: Actually no
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Tara: I can live without my phone
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll send u emails
22/05/2022, 19:31 - Tara: I once went on an hour long walk and I didn't even listen to music
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: i will send u carrier pidgeons
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: wowo
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Tara: I'm just gonna delete all messages from people instead
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Tara: Besides you
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Tara: Too much tea here
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: that may sound sarcastic but i'm genuinely in adoration
22/05/2022, 19:32 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH glad i can help brighten ur day with tea
22/05/2022, 19:33 - Tara: You are my supplier
22/05/2022, 19:33 - Tara: For me and sibling because I'm sorry but she knows everything
22/05/2022, 19:33 - Tara: She doesn't count you know
22/05/2022, 19:33 - Tara: She doesn't tell anyone
She gives me advice which I relay to you and pass as my own wisdom /s
22/05/2022, 19:34 - Tara: Nah she only gives advice to me hehe
22/05/2022, 19:34 - Tara: Favouritism
22/05/2022, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH fair enough
22/05/2022, 19:34 - Sandeepti Singh: wait like everything
22/05/2022, 19:35 - Tara: Most of it
22/05/2022, 19:35 - Tara: Some stuff I'm like hmm better not
22/05/2022, 19:36 - Tara: You know how you said you talk me up to your brother
I do the same to sibling for you
22/05/2022, 19:36 - Tara: You're welcome
22/05/2022, 19:37 - Sandeepti Singh: i wanna see her raw reactions
22/05/2022, 19:37 - Sandeepti Singh: wow thanks
22/05/2022, 19:37 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHA i'm curious to know what stuff u thought was too bad that sibling can't know
22/05/2022, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
22/05/2022, 19:42 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
22/05/2022, 19:45 - Tara: It's not bad stuff
Just emotions
22/05/2022, 19:47 - Sandeepti Singh: ah
22/05/2022, 19:47 - Tara: I certainly didn't tell her about the time Efje and I got higj
22/05/2022, 19:47 - Tara: Like no
22/05/2022, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA i still can't believe you did that
22/05/2022, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: i am surprised about it every single time
22/05/2022, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: me
22/05/2022, 19:48 - Sandeepti Singh: with the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair
22/05/2022, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: oh question about q 4 B
22/05/2022, 20:04 - Sandeepti Singh: i mean Q8 B
22/05/2022, 20:05 - Sandeepti Singh: actually after Part A i do not get that question
22/05/2022, 20:37 - Tara: Ok I check
22/05/2022, 20:38 - Tara: Dhakxjahc
22/05/2022, 20:38 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 20:39 - Tara: I want to do it again but this time not do it late at night so I fall asleep
22/05/2022, 21:02 - Tara: Oh god
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Tara: It's modulation
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Tara: No
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: wow i can't believe u will do it again hhahaha
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: yes i had the same reaction
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Tara: Well fudge we need to really get cracking on modulation
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: we don't have to
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: but i feel like there'll def be a modulation question
22/05/2022, 21:03 - Sandeepti Singh: i get like part A for question 8
22/05/2022, 21:05 - Tara: part b i think
-Fc0 = 250
Fc0 = 350
if you only want Fc0 onwards
then it would be 300-350Hz
22/05/2022, 21:05 - Tara: Fd=300?
22/05/2022, 21:07 - Tara: no idk
22/05/2022, 21:07 - Tara: im going to draw it
22/05/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: You know how haruki sent me the message that was meant for u
22/05/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: my instinct was racism
22/05/2022, 21:09 - Tara: oh ok
22/05/2022, 21:09 - Sandeepti Singh: but then i was reminded
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: _oh_
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: not korean guy?
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: ma'am wait
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: i meant
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: it was reminded to me
22/05/2022, 21:10 - Sandeepti Singh: that our profile pics
22/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: ohhhh
22/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: omg
22/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: ok i think i know why it's 300
22/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: so the range is 250-350
the only signal that is within that range is the trapezium
22/05/2022, 21:11 - Tara: and its midpoint is 300
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: part c
340-300 = 40
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but it goes through the moducation first
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: ?
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: with the signal d
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: ya
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Tara: i mean demodulated right
22/05/2022, 21:12 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah demodulation
22/05/2022, 21:13 - Tara: im very glad we're talking about this because i was also confused before
22/05/2022, 21:13 - Tara: part d should be fine
22/05/2022, 21:13 - Tara: *2 in the middle
*1 on either side
22/05/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah
22/05/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: but i don't get part b
22/05/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: like i get the part up until it being put through the fitler
22/05/2022, 21:14 - Sandeepti Singh: then what purpose does the demodulation have?
22/05/2022, 21:14 - Tara: to get F
22/05/2022, 21:15 - Tara: they only want one of the signals
22/05/2022, 21:15 - Tara: and because of the limits they gave us (250-350)
22/05/2022, 21:16 - Tara: wait im repeating myself
22/05/2022, 21:19 - Tara: <Media omitted>
22/05/2022, 21:19 - Tara: Does this help?
22/05/2022, 21:22 - Sandeepti Singh: okay i got up to that part
22/05/2022, 21:22 - Sandeepti Singh: then thought that i was underthinking it
22/05/2022, 21:23 - Sandeepti Singh: my thinking was it goes through the filter and is then mixed with something else
22/05/2022, 21:23 - Sandeepti Singh: and they were asking the frequency for that
22/05/2022, 21:23 - Sandeepti Singh: but yea i think i'm overthinking
22/05/2022, 21:23 - Sandeepti Singh: this one is the straightforward way
22/05/2022, 21:24 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh i get it now
22/05/2022, 21:25 - Sandeepti Singh: you just want it to be at 0 so u use the frequency of the centre thing
22/05/2022, 21:27 - Tara: yes
22/05/2022, 21:37 - Sandeepti Singh: have u done 2020s final
22/05/2022, 21:37 - Tara: yes
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Tara: oh
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Tara: no i have not
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Tara: sorry
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Tara: was looking at my midterm folder
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Tara: doing it tomorrow
22/05/2022, 21:38 - Sandeepti Singh: okay lemme start with the ones u have then
22/05/2022, 21:39 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll do 2019F then
22/05/2022, 21:39 - Tara: ive done everything besides
2019F midterm review
2020 * 2

22/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: it's just
22/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: neutral
22/05/2022, 23:17 - Tara: it doesn't affect me
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: actually depends on the situation
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: what u r saying is you're not an empathTM
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: yeah
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: i am now an empathTM
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Tara: nein you have abandoned me
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm maybe try to show care a teeeeeeeny bit more
22/05/2022, 23:18 - Sandeepti Singh: idm u the way u are
22/05/2022, 23:19 - Tara: e.g. with efje
didnt really say anything about her spring plans
22/05/2022, 23:19 - Tara: because i was like wait i thought you were going in spring but i couldnt say that
22/05/2022, 23:19 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i think peoiple might assume u don't care
22/05/2022, 23:19 - Tara: so i defaulted to questioning her
22/05/2022, 23:20 - Tara: in conversations i usually just ask people questions instead of offering details about my own life
22/05/2022, 23:20 - Tara: because there's not much to talk about
22/05/2022, 23:20 - Tara: when i met cindy's bf i may have interrogated him
22/05/2022, 23:22 - Tara: bruh you're becoming more like efje

22/05/2022, 23:22 - Tara: i wonder if efje is becoming more like you
22/05/2022, 23:28 - Tara: good thing is that we're both aware of this
22/05/2022, 23:28 - Tara: are we so anxiety-ridden that we're hyper self-aware
22/05/2022, 23:55 - Tara: ok serious question

23/05/2022, 09:45 - Tara: I will never let myself have coffee ~at night~
23/05/2022, 11:06 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHA
23/05/2022, 11:07 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah i feel like i told u
23/05/2022, 11:07 - Sandeepti Singh: i remember blaming it all on the tiramisu
23/05/2022, 11:14 - Sandeepti Singh: did u have black coffee?
23/05/2022, 11:14 - Sandeepti Singh: like did ur coffee just have too much caffine
23/05/2022, 11:14 - Tara: lemme check
23/05/2022, 11:18 - Tara: Nope it had a rating of 4/11
23/05/2022, 11:18 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA
23/05/2022, 11:18 - Sandeepti Singh: did u order it from starbucks or soemthing?
23/05/2022, 11:19 - Tara: No made it at home
23/05/2022, 11:19 - Tara: I think I'm just weak
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHHA maybe so
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: we need to slowly build up your tolerance lol
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: it is now my aim for summer
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Tara: Wait what
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: gonna slip coffee in everything u eat or drink
23/05/2022, 11:20 - Sandeepti Singh: and bulid up ur tolerance hah
23/05/2022, 11:21 - Tara: The last time someone offered to build up something for me was last year when Efje was like oh we need to work on your poker face / nonchalance and now it's a problem
23/05/2022, 11:21 - Tara: I may or may not become addicted
23/05/2022, 11:21 - Tara: Imagine eating roti or something and you come in and dump coffee on it
23/05/2022, 11:23 - Tara: I tried telling people I was a global India studies major right
23/05/2022, 11:23 - Tara: And ofc no one believed me because I kept grinning like a fool
23/05/2022, 11:23 - Sandeepti Singh: no i would infuse the coffee in the aata before the roti was made i'm not dumb
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHA i wanna see that lmao
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Smiling?
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Sandeepti Singh: "grinning like a fool"
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Or telling people about my major
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Oh
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Tara: Yeah
23/05/2022, 11:24 - Sandeepti Singh: u grinning will telling them about your major
23/05/2022, 11:25 - Sandeepti Singh: are u ready for 2400?
23/05/2022, 11:25 - Tara: Yep
23/05/2022, 11:25 - Tara: Hey I'll tell Alex that I'm a global India studies major if I meet him
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: omy i still haven't responded to him
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: you know when it gets to like a day
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: and then ur like oh too late
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: he texted me on the 13th
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Tara: I- so you are no longer friends with him?
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Tara: Reply
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Tara: Shoo
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: so i think i might text him after finals
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Tara: Ok fine
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Tara: I will remind you
23/05/2022, 11:26 - Sandeepti Singh: like i completely missed his message soemhow
23/05/2022, 11:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i think it will seem like i genuinely forgot
23/05/2022, 11:27 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz who i ntheir right mind would ignore a message for that long while being aware of
23/05/2022, 11:27 - Sandeepti Singh: and still text back lol
23/05/2022, 11:27 - Tara: He doesn't know your texting habits
This is your time to make shit up
23/05/2022, 11:27 - Tara: / tell the truth
23/05/2022, 11:29 - Sandeepti Singh: i choose the former
23/05/2022, 11:32 - Tara: I think I'm going to sleep for a tiny bit after 2400
23/05/2022, 11:32 - Tara: Then eat lunch and work
23/05/2022, 11:32 - Sandeepti Singh: okiee
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll try to work duruing ur exam
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Tara: (I say this but 90% of the time I don't sleep)
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: so that we can go through past papers together
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Tara: Yes
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Tara: I'll zoom through the papers
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Sandeepti Singh: i should finish at least 2019 and then the on or two midterm questions that were about the finals
23/05/2022, 11:33 - Tara: I've been thinking about the type of questions that can come up
23/05/2022, 11:34 - Tara: In the written part
23/05/2022, 11:34 - Sandeepti Singh: i really want there to be one on djastra's algo
23/05/2022, 11:34 - Tara: 1. Coding
2. Aloha
3. Dijkstra (the tables)
23/05/2022, 11:34 - Sandeepti Singh: and one on the parity bits
23/05/2022, 11:34 - Tara: I think modulation and stuff will be MCQ
23/05/2022, 11:35 - Tara: Because it takes too much time to write the entire equation
23/05/2022, 11:35 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah but i think one modulation could be in the long answer
23/05/2022, 11:35 - Tara: Hmm like maybe just the frequencies?
23/05/2022, 11:35 - Tara: Oh and then we have homework 1 too
23/05/2022, 11:35 - Tara: What did we do there
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: like the error could come uo
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: up
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: but i don't think it'll come uo
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: up
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Sandeepti Singh: it was a whole question in the midterm
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Tara: Yeah
23/05/2022, 11:36 - Tara: Hmm I feel like homework 1 stuff will come up as MCQ
23/05/2022, 11:37 - Tara: Because what else could they test that wasn't on the midterm long answer questions
23/05/2022, 11:37 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah hmm true
23/05/2022, 11:37 - Tara: I think we'll do fine
23/05/2022, 11:37 - Tara: I just need to be super careful about MCQ
23/05/2022, 11:38 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 11:39 - Tara: ~im so tired maybe I should have some coffee~
23/05/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: yeahh
23/05/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: noooo
23/05/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: but i mean coffee didn't let u sleep
23/05/2022, 11:39 - Sandeepti Singh: it fulfilled it's purpose
23/05/2022, 11:40 - Sandeepti Singh: i wish it worked like that on me
23/05/2022, 11:40 - Tara: Oui I'll just be really anxious during the exam
23/05/2022, 11:44 - Sandeepti Singh: haha
23/05/2022, 11:44 - Sandeepti Singh: how long is your exam
23/05/2022, 11:45 - Tara: 3 hours
23/05/2022, 11:45 - Tara: But I'm joining at 12
23/05/2022, 11:45 - Tara: It starts at 12:30
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Sandeepti Singh: ohh okie
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Sandeepti Singh: gl then
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Tara: hahaha
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Tara: thank you
23/05/2022, 11:54 - Tara: im saving that

23/05/2022, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: okie gl
23/05/2022, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: byeee
23/05/2022, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: This message was deleted
23/05/2022, 11:57 - Sandeepti Singh: muah
23/05/2022, 11:57 - Tara: mwah
23/05/2022, 16:12 - Sandeepti Singh: How was 2400
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Sandeepti Singh: Also u’r supposed to be napping ma’am
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: nein i no sleepy
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: i mean i am idk why i said that
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: it was ok
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: i dunno
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: no time to recheck
23/05/2022, 16:13 - Tara: by napping i mean i will lie in bed and watch tv
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: I did 2019
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Many questions
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: We go through later though
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Sandeepti Singh: My brain hurts
23/05/2022, 16:14 - Tara: ok
23/05/2022, 16:16 - Tara: oh wait no i have to eat lunch too
23/05/2022, 16:17 - Tara: i guess i'll just sleep at a reasonable time again
23/05/2022, 16:17 - Tara: but actually sleep this time
23/05/2022, 16:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Nah eat lunch and then go sleep?
23/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: fine
23/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: i will start working at 5:30
23/05/2022, 16:20 - Tara: only because you're forcing me to /s
23/05/2022, 16:25 - Sandeepti Singh: HHaha
23/05/2022, 16:59 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 17:13 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAHAHA
23/05/2022, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: yo is it okay if we zoom 10 on?
23/05/2022, 17:25 - Sandeepti Singh: or is that too late
23/05/2022, 17:26 - Sandeepti Singh: i wanna basically do all the pastpapers and prep before so we discuss everything properly?
23/05/2022, 17:28 - Tara: sure 10 is fine
23/05/2022, 17:39 - Sandeepti Singh: nicee
23/05/2022, 18:48 - Sandeepti Singh: what's a 5,1,5 encoder
23/05/2022, 18:48 - Sandeepti Singh: how would that even wor k
23/05/2022, 18:48 - Sandeepti Singh: 1 is the number of bits you're transmitting with 4 parity bits?
23/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: hmm wait they say 8 bit message in 5,1,5 encoder?
23/05/2022, 18:49 - Sandeepti Singh: also do u wanna zoom a bit now and then we can break for dinner and then zppm after?
23/05/2022, 18:50 - Tara: im nearly done with this paper just gimme a few minutes
23/05/2022, 18:50 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i'm not done with 2020 though yet
23/05/2022, 18:52 - Tara: same havent done 2020 yet
23/05/2022, 18:52 - Sandeepti Singh: ahh okay then let's just do 10
23/05/2022, 18:52 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll just make a note of the doubts for now
23/05/2022, 18:52 - Sandeepti Singh: i think that's most efficient
23/05/2022, 18:52 - Tara: ok
23/05/2022, 18:53 - Tara: yeah i also need to note my questions down
23/05/2022, 18:53 - Sandeepti Singh: watch them all being identical
23/05/2022, 18:59 - Tara: well fuck
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Tara: doing the BER questions make me want to perish
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: bro same
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Tara: they're so boring and long and difficult
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah now i draw it and then directly graph it
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: use the graphing integral option
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Sandeepti Singh: so i don't have to write the stuff down
23/05/2022, 19:01 - Tara: i love my calculator + square paper
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHAH
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Sandeepti Singh: oh are u using ipad for the exam?
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: i should treat my calculator better
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: yes
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Sandeepti Singh: okie good
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: will use square paper ✨
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Tara: a true lifesaver
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Sandeepti Singh: cuz i would genuinely perish without my calculator
23/05/2022, 19:02 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHA
23/05/2022, 19:15 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 19:15 - Tara: or S5 the entire thing
23/05/2022, 19:16 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 19:16 - Tara: P5 must be for D1-P4 right
23/05/2022, 19:16 - Tara: And S5 for everything?
23/05/2022, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: oh i dunno? i treat P5 as the sum of P1, P2 and P3,P4
23/05/2022, 19:20 - Sandeepti Singh: but the diagonal makes more sense i think?
23/05/2022, 19:20 - Tara: ok the question says two bit errors max
23/05/2022, 19:20 - Tara: if we do diagonal then it's 3
23/05/2022, 19:20 - Tara: so must be P1-4
23/05/2022, 19:21 - Sandeepti Singh: but without diagonal i get 0 errors
23/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: how about S3 and S4
23/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: oml
23/05/2022, 19:21 - Tara: i wrote it incorrectly
23/05/2022, 19:22 - Tara: hhh
23/05/2022, 19:22 - Sandeepti Singh: oh what do u get for that??
23/05/2022, 19:22 - Tara: im highlighting it
23/05/2022, 19:23 - Tara: to check later
23/05/2022, 19:23 - Tara: because idk
23/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: same
23/05/2022, 19:24 - Sandeepti Singh: lol
23/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: they need to make an emoji for the cat smooshing its head into the pillow
23/05/2022, 19:25 - Tara: because ???
23/05/2022, 19:25 - Sandeepti Singh: HAHA
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Tara: question 5
5 layers
4 descriptions
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Tara: what is this
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah bro that's what i was asking
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Tara: oml
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Tara: well
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Tara: physical layer is the odd duck
23/05/2022, 19:26 - Sandeepti Singh: so i get that they separated the 8 bits into 8 different frames?
23/05/2022, 19:27 - Tara: because that's just the bits on the wire
23/05/2022, 19:27 - Sandeepti Singh: oh wrong question nvm
23/05/2022, 19:27 - Tara: hmm?
23/05/2022, 19:27 - Tara: oh
23/05/2022, 19:27 - Tara: ok
23/05/2022, 20:27 - Tara: bruh the professors are jokers how is the 2020 final _70_ minutes long
23/05/2022, 21:00 - Tara: ok so what papers have you done again
i've done
2013f midterm
2015f midterm
2015s final review
2016s final review
2018f midterm review
2019f final
2019f midterm review
2020f homework 2 (got some questions)
2020f homework 3 (questions again)
23/05/2022, 21:06 - Tara: holy shoot the number of questions i have is bad
23/05/2022, 21:06 - Sandeepti Singh: I have not done that many yet
23/05/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I haven’t done last year’s hw yet
23/05/2022, 21:07 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: I’ve done this year’s review and 2020 and 2019 finals
23/05/2022, 21:07 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmm maybe I can just do the one’s ur not fine with
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: So I can help out and also do the harder questions?
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: sure
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: thanks
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Sandeepti Singh: Npp. I dunno if I can do it by 10 though? Maybe we can go through some of them together?
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: also homework 3 im fine with 
i saw a blank space and assumed i didnt know how to do it but turns out i did it earlier
23/05/2022, 21:08 - Tara: sounds good
23/05/2022, 21:09 - Tara: im going to take a break
23/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: Current mood
23/05/2022, 21:10 - Tara: <Media omitted>
23/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: It says
P5: parity for D1-D4, P1-P4
Entire codeword for even parity (S5)
23/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: Don't get S5 though
23/05/2022, 22:09 - Tara: so that's just D1-P5?
23/05/2022, 22:12 - Sandeepti Singh: maybe? like sum up all the bits
23/05/2022, 22:12 - Sandeepti Singh: i'm done with 2020 and 2019
23/05/2022, 22:12 - Tara: yay
23/05/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: i was looking through the other ones and i think 2015 has 2 new questions and 2016 has like 1 new question
23/05/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: i haven't done those but i'll do them tonight
23/05/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: but maybe we can go through these first
23/05/2022, 22:13 - Tara: ok
23/05/2022, 22:13 - Sandeepti Singh: and also the ones from the hw that u had a doubt in
23/05/2022, 22:14 - Sandeepti Singh: gimme a few min and i'll zoom?
23/05/2022, 22:14 - Tara: sure yeah
23/05/2022, 22:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll call now?
23/05/2022, 22:27 - Tara: oui
23/05/2022, 22:27 - Sandeepti Singh: i'll just join with my ipad so it's easier
23/05/2022, 23:38 - Tara: Probability of collision: 1 - [N * p^1 * (1-p)^(N-1)]
23/05/2022, 23:41 - Tara: p1 = 1/N=1/2=0.5
23/05/2022, 23:41 - Tara: p2=1.2p1=1.2/N=0.6
24/05/2022, 00:05 - Tara: Sorry for calling you annoying mwah

24/05/2022, 11:08 - Tara: Protocol stack
1. Application: supporting network applications • HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS
Client-server architecture
server:
- always-on host
- permanent IP address
- server farms for scaling
clients:
- communicate with server
- may be intermittently connected
- may have dynamic IP addresses
- do not communicate directly with each other

Pure P2P architecture
- no always-on server
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses

Servers
- SMTP simple mail transfer protocol. Electronic mail delivery protocol
- Telnet Terminal emulation. Enables login and interactive session on a remote system
- FTP File transfer protocol. Reliable file transfer. Allows ASCII and binary files to be transferred interactively
- DNS Domain Name system. Name service used by the Internet. Can use both TCP and UDP transport-layer protocols
- HTTP 

Web and HTTP
- Web page consists of objects
- Object can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file
- Web page consists of base HTML-file which includes several referenced objects
- Each object is addressable by a URL

HTTP
- Web’s application layer protocol over TCP
Client/server model
- client: browser that requests, receives, “displays” Web objects
- server: Web server sends objects in response to requests

Web caches: satisfy client request without involving origin server.

DNS: Domain Name System
- An Internet-wide service that provides mappings between IP addresses and hostnames
- distributed database that resides in multiple machines in the Internet, implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
- application-layer protocol host, routers, name servers to communicate to resolve names (address/name translation)
- note: an essential Internet function, implemented as application-layer protocol - usually involves short messages, and so primarily uses services provided by UDP

Local name servers
- each ISP, company has local (default) name server
- host DNS query first goes to local name server
Authoritative name server
- every host is registered with at least two authoritative servers which store that host’s IP address, name
- Can perform name/address translation for that host
Root name servers
- contacted by local name server that cannot resolve name
1. contacts authoritative name server if name mapping not known
2. gets mapping
3. returns mapping to local name server

Once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches mapping
- cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time
- TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
- Thus root name servers not often visited


2. Transport: process-process data transfer • TCP, UDP
Provide logical communication between app processes running on different hosts
Transport protocols run in end systems 
– send side: breaks app messages into segments, passes to network layer
– rcv side: reassembles segments into messages, passes to app layer

Internet: TCP and UDP
TCP: reliable, in-order
– congestion control 
– flow control
– connection setup
UDP: unreliable, unordered
– no-frills extension of “besteffort” IP

Functions
- Multiplexing / demultiplexing		TCP, UDP
- Error detection			TCP, UDP
- Reliable data transfer		TCP
- Flow control				TCP
- Congestion control			TCP
- Connection management			TCP

TCP reliable data transfer
Sender
- Each segment contains sequence number
- Sent segments saved in buffer
- When acknowledgement (ACK) received from  destination, remove segment from buffer
- Retransmit segment if ACK not received after “a while.”
Receiver
- Send ACK to sender for each received packet. Indicate sequence number.
- Deliver segments to application according to sequence number

Throughput
No losses: 1/T = 1/RTT
Losses: T = (1-L)*RTT + L*(RTO+RTT)
	  = RTT + [L/(1-L)]*RTO
Best case: T = RTT/(1-L)




3. Network: routing of datagrams from source to destination • IP, routing protocols
- Packets forwarded using destination host address.
- IP: network layer of internet

Functions
- Routing: determine route taken by packets from source to destination.
- Forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output.

IP address: 32-bit long (4 bytes) identifier for host, router, interface.
Interface: connection between host/router and physical link.
IPv4 (32-bit long), max of 2^32 addresses.

Subnet: device interfaces with the same subnet part of IP address, can physically reach each other without intervening router.
CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing
a.b.c.d/x, x = no. bits in subnet portion of address.

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Goal: allow host to dynamically obtain its IP address from network server when it joins the network.
1. host broadcasts “DHCP discover” msg
2. DHCP server responds with “DHCP offer” msg
3. host requests IP address: “DHCP request” msg
4. DHCP server sends address: “DHCP ack” msg

IPv6: fixed-length 40 byte header, max of 2^128 addresses.




4. Link: data transfer between neighboring network elements • 802.11, Ethernet
Data-link layer: transferring datagram from one node to adjacent node over a link.
Data transmitted in units of frames (groups of bits)
Services
- Framing, link access - encapsulates datagram into frame, adding header, trailer.
- Error detection - signals sende for retransmission / drops frames.
- Error correction: receiver identifies and corrects bit errors without retransmitting.
Sending side						Receiving side
- Encapsulates datagram in frame.			- Looks for errors
- Adds error checking bits and other headers.		- Extracts datagram, passes to upper layer
Two types of links: point to point (PPP) and broadcast (sared wire / medium)
Multiple Access Protocol							Ideal
- Distributed algorithm that determines how nodes share channel.		When M nodes want to transmit at rate R, average rate = R/M
- Communication about channel sharing must use channel itself.			Simple
										Fully decentralised
Media Access Control (MAC) Protocols
- Channel partitioning: divide channel into smaller pieces.
- Random access: channel not divided, allows collisions.
- Taking turns: nodes take turns, but nodes with more to send can take longer turns.

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)				Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
- Access to channel in rounds.					- Channel spectrum divided into frequency bands.
- Each station gets fixed-length slot in each round.		- Each station assigned fixed frequency band.
- Unused slots go idle.						- Unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle.

Random access protocols
- How to detect collisions.
- How to recover from collisions.
e.g. slotted ALOHA, pure ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

Slotted ALOHA
- Time divided into slots equal to length of one packet.
- Packets transmitted starting only at the start of each slot.
- If collision, both packets lost
Pros										Cons
- Single active node can continuously transmit at full rate of channel.		- Collisions, wasting slots
- Highly decentralised.								- Idle slots
- Simple									- Once collision occurs, entire slot is wasted.
										- Clock synchronisation
Effiency: fraction of time slots w/ successful transmission.
Throughput: number of packets transmitted per time interval.
Assumptions
- Nodes operate independently
- Each node has a queue to hold packets.
- If the queue is non-empty, the node is backlogged.
- Backlogged nodes send packets in each timeslot with probability p
- Assume N nodes are backlogged.
N nodes, probability of transmission p
No node transmits in slot: (1-p)^N
Partiular node transmits w/o collision: N * p * (1-p)^(N-1)
Probability of collision: 1 - [N * p^1 * (1-p)^(N-1)]
Efficiency: N * p * (1-p)^(N-1)
Max efficiency: p=1/N




5. Physical: bits “on the wire”

24/05/2022, 14:49 - Tara: They have the questions
24/05/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: yeah we can see the wrong answers
24/05/2022, 14:49 - Sandeepti Singh: the agape one
24/05/2022, 14:50 - Tara: Question 3 and 10
24/05/2022, 14:50 - Tara: And in the second part I focused too much on Marx or something
24/05/2022, 14:51 - Tara: Don't feel bad about it because that question was terrible
24/05/2022, 14:53 - Sandeepti Singh: ohhh
24/05/2022, 14:53 - Sandeepti Singh: i think we should be above mean
24/05/2022, 14:53 - Tara: Yeah the mean is like 14
24/05/2022, 14:55 - Tara: Do they factor in the attendance grade
24/05/2022, 14:55 - Tara: Oh
24/05/2022, 14:55 - Tara: It's 2.2% of the final grade haha

24/05/2022, 16:00 - Tara: Oh right
24/05/2022, 16:02 - Tara: Ha you know the CSE challenge that Siddarth asked me to vote for
24/05/2022, 16:03 - Tara: So two things
First thing is that I did not vote for him because when he pitched his idea I had no clue what he was talking about and I didn't understand how it would be useful
Second thing is that I won a $100 Starbucks coupon because I voted for the dude who came in first place
24/05/2022, 16:36 - Tara: When do you wanna start this btw
24/05/2022, 16:51 - Tara: oh jesus bro the jp morgan virtual experience thingy

24/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh when did u vote for the thing?
24/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Also lmaooo great job on u
24/05/2022, 20:10 - Sandeepti Singh: Did they actually give u a 100 dollars just cuz u voted for the winning one
24/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh in a few days
24/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh we usually do not need to book the room
24/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: We can just go
24/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: Oooh okay important question
24/05/2022, 20:11 - Sandeepti Singh: We are deciding a book to read like a book club

24/05/2022, 20:14 - Tara: ? What's it about?
24/05/2022, 20:14 - Tara: The sack of Troy from the women's POV
24/05/2022, 20:14 - Sandeepti Singh: What’s the sack of t on
24/05/2022, 20:14 - Sandeepti Singh: Troy
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: Well you know the Trojan horse right
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yea
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Sandeepti Singh: I am familiar with it
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: Some fellas in the horse went into Troy and opened the gate
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: And then the Greeks sacked it
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: Set fire to the citadel
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: Killed everyone
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Tara: Captured a bunch of people
24/05/2022, 20:15 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah I know that
24/05/2022, 20:16 - Tara: ??
24/05/2022, 20:16 - Tara: Confusion
24/05/2022, 20:16 - Sandeepti Singh: Is that it? Oh lol
24/05/2022, 20:16 - Sandeepti Singh: I thought it was some extra thing I didn’t know about
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: Nah
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Sandeepti Singh: Prisha refuses to read mythology
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: Damn
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Sandeepti Singh: <Media omitted>
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: That goes half the books
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: Uh
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: I like this though
24/05/2022, 20:17 - Tara: Fav book so far
24/05/2022, 20:18 - Sandeepti Singh: Ikr so annoying
24/05/2022, 20:18 - Tara: Bruh I need to check Goodreads
24/05/2022, 20:18 - Tara: Brb
24/05/2022, 20:18 - Tara: Also
24/05/2022, 20:18 - Tara: I'm watching task master
24/05/2022, 20:19 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh yayyyy

24/05/2022, 20:31 - Tara: So where are we going
24/05/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh we went with invisible life of Addie la eye
24/05/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Rue
24/05/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Which is weird cuz I’ve already ready like half of it hahah
24/05/2022, 21:35 - Sandeepti Singh: Gives me a head start
24/05/2022, 21:35 - Tara: Yeah I was just gonna say

Sibling reads a lot right

Romance is gross but let's move past that
She's also part of a chat called disaster gay central

24/05/2022, 22:41 - Tara: Hahaah

24/05/2022, 22:41 - Sandeepti Singh: they are all spicier ways of saying no-homosexual
24/05/2022, 22:41 - Tara: It's like the opposite of feuirt

24/05/2022, 22:46 - Tara: She could very well not be LGBT and just
1. Loves romance

29/05/2022, 10:38 - Tara: Wait I just woke up let me reread what I wrote
29/05/2022, 10:38 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahah
29/05/2022, 10:39 - Tara: Have you never reminisced about for example your friendship with someone
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm not really I think?
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Sandeepti Singh: What were u reminiscing about?
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Tara: Nothing
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Tara: I mean I reminisce all the time
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Tara: Nothing new
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohhh
29/05/2022, 10:40 - Sandeepti Singh: Is it fun reminiscing or sad reminiscing
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Tara: Mostly fun
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Tara: Or else I'd be sad all the time
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Sandeepti Singh: True
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I don’t think I reminisce usually
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Sandeepti Singh: I dunno why
29/05/2022, 10:41 - Sandeepti Singh: But my brain
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Sandeepti Singh: Remembers stuff in a bad light? Or mostly only remembers the bad stuff
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Tara: Aw no
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Sandeepti Singh: So it’s usually a bad idea to reminisce
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Tara: So even the nice stuff like uh
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Tara: Idk
29/05/2022, 10:42 - Tara: Your birthday
29/05/2022, 10:43 - Tara: You don't remember?
29/05/2022, 10:43 - Sandeepti Singh: No like I do remember but if I try to think about the past like 70% would be the bad stuff
29/05/2022, 10:43 - Sandeepti Singh: Or even if I do remember good stuff I’ll just focus on bad lmao
29/05/2022, 10:43 - Sandeepti Singh: So solution: just don’t think hahah
29/05/2022, 10:43 - Tara: Damn bro that's sad
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Not really I remember a lot of fun stuff too
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Tara: Bro
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: But I do remember it
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: I just need to think a bit harder to make myself focus on the good stuff???
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Sandeepti Singh: So weird
29/05/2022, 10:44 - Tara: Yes do that
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Tara: Remember the happy stuff
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Yeah. Agreed. It’s not instinct but I am trying ✨
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Like yesterday I remember as only being fun
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: So that’s a yay
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Tara: 👏👏👏
29/05/2022, 10:45 - Sandeepti Singh: Did u just wake up?
29/05/2022, 10:46 - Tara: Unfortunately half the memories from last year have been tainted by Siddarth but it's ok because I have more friends
29/05/2022, 10:46 - Tara: Yes
29/05/2022, 10:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Oh no
29/05/2022, 10:46 - Tara: As Patsy says I must reshift my focus
29/05/2022, 10:46 - Sandeepti Singh: Actually yea same (obviously not to that level or that time. Yours is def much worse haha)
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Hmmm maybe try not to focus on the memories being tainted??? Like just remember the memories as being good???
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Sandeepti Singh: I feel like that would be hard though
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: No you're right
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: Think about it objectively
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: What Feelings etc you felt then
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz even if it ended up badly u had loads of fun during it
29/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: Instead of what you feel about the event now
29/05/2022, 10:48 - Tara: Genius

30/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Cuz it’s cosines and complex exponential
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: bro that's a perfect idea
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: And I was like he can do poisson in the beginning
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: To see the probability that two messages of the same frequency might collide or soemthing
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Tara: ALOHA?
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: And then talk about modulation and demodulation as a way to solve it
30/05/2022, 00:56 - Sandeepti Singh: No 2600
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: oh i see
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: wow great idea

30/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: But yes I can send it to u hahah
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: hehe thanks
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: But damn it means I will have to explain modulation to him
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: should i offer sibling's in exchange
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: When I barely understand
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: just send him the slides
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Tara: he'll figure it out
30/05/2022, 00:57 - Sandeepti Singh: HHaha sure???
30/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: idk if i have it
30/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: but i can tell you what it was about
30/05/2022, 00:58 - Sandeepti Singh: Hahaha what is it about?
30/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: newton's law of cooling + chicken + crime
30/05/2022, 00:58 - Tara: you kill someone
30/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: you apply newton's law of cooling
30/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: find the time of death
30/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: apparently she modelled it perfectly
30/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: but im slightly mad because this is just basic physics
30/05/2022, 00:59 - Tara: we learn it in topic 3 right
30/05/2022, 01:00 - Tara: but she still got 19/20??

30/05/2022, 01:00 - Tara: smh jealous

30/05/2022, 22:52 - Tara: <Media omitted>
30/05/2022, 23:23 - Tara: I was thinking about the bingo
In the event people don't know what to write we can compile a list of what people have said before hand
Just to make their lives easier
They will ofc have to come up with their own though
30/05/2022, 23:25 - Tara: We can't ask them to come up with it because they'll be stumped all over again
30/05/2022, 23:25 - Tara: We'll just have to go through messages I guess
31/05/2022, 10:26 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh true but that’s so smart
31/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: Sorry thought of a better thing
We send a poll asking them what they would say and use that
31/05/2022, 10:47 - Tara: We've got 5 other people
We can ask for 10? Is that too much
31/05/2022, 10:49 - Tara: We can make a spreadsheet
Lock the tabs for different people 
Have them update it whenever they want
31/05/2022, 10:56 - Sandeepti Singh: Ohh this sounds too much work
31/05/2022, 10:56 - Sandeepti Singh: I think the point of the bingo card is to know how much people know each other
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Tara: Yeah but the backup stuff
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Sandeepti Singh: So the point is that the people try write it themselves
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Sandeepti Singh: If they don’t know enough they’ll have to come with random stuff and loose
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Tara: Ah
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Tara: Devilish
31/05/2022, 10:57 - Sandeepti Singh: Exaclty
